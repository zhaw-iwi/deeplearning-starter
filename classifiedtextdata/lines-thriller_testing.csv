I'm sure they're around.
It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
You think you matter?  -Beaumont is on that train- he matters-
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
Pleasant journey?
How could it be? I hate Africa.
I do need to see Starling.
What have they done besides kill Starling?  How many have they killed?
And it worked?
In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound.
All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
Understand, I had help-
-not a time for modesty, Bob-
Then why do you stay?
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
What if there are complications?-
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
Don't much like them.
Anything special about them?
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
Yes- but their suffering is only transitory- once they except God into their hearts, He will vanquish all pain.
Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced.  Why not, indeed!
-true enough- but without the comedy relief.
I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size.
That's what the books say...
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
You mean nobody died?
Have you got it?
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means slaughter...
Oh yes, I think so.
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
Thank you, Samuel.
Do you love her?
How many cattle?
Where do you go next?
Help finish the railroad.
I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
T-T-Thanks Alice...
Hey man, we're all sorry...
What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
Huh?
Where is he?
What do you mean?
But how...?
I know.
But Dad --
Had kind of a long night.
Did everyone call everyone?
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
You do good work, Alice.
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
I thought about that.
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.
My baby!
You wanna talk to me straight up?
Your what?
It'll never happen again. I swear.
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
You ever hear about the oranges?
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Where are you going?
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
I know.
Whadaya say?
So I heard.
Just myself.
That's their problem.
Well...
So what's your story today?
They twisted my arm.
Don't mention it.
You always did.
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
He let me live. He let me be his friend.
You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that!
Get off the grift, Roy.
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
No. That was the point.
No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
You must have some money.
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
You want a drink?
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
I am in school.
Are you sure?
No, baby. Come to Mama.
Her job.
I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
I don't see why we have to take the train.
What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
No.
See you soon.
I'll sign that affidavit.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
Myra, I'm not following this.
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
And when he got serious?
I thought these people were broke.
Take a hike, you mean?
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
I went out to Delmar.
She didn't see you, in other words.
I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds.
And hello to you, too.
Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?
What?
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
But the setup's there. It's there now.
No! Because I --
That's what I say.
I'm happy the way I am.
What's that?
Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
Thank you.
Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
I realize this is a shock.
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
Yes, I know, I know.
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
That's true, Mr. Simms.
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
My god...
What the --
You're twisted.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
It's an option.
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
I was trying to protect you from this...
That would work.
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
I borrowed it.
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
Here, take my jacket.
Who?!
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?
You're right.  It does sound strange.
Who?
No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  It's the truth.
Never.
Do we have to invite him to the wedding?
Two hours a day, six days a week.
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
Found this morning.  In a field outside Haddonfield.  Stabbed.
Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
Stick around, please?
We need you, Dr. Loomis.
What is that?
Why did you take Jamie?
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
We're all risking our lives!
Which is the one - we have to worry about?
And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a rough reception, won't we?
Helen.  I appeal to you -
That's the worst possible moment?
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
Listen!  Hear that?
Dave - !
What's the matter with her?
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.
What do you mean?
The boxes! I TOLD you.
Finish what?
I met Dr. Kent, once.
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
Minus three.
He did!
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
Yeah. I know about that.
This spring.
Oh.
Yeah.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
Shit! What are we gonna do?
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
We bought you.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
Drafted by the Red Sox.
Double A. New Britain.
Oh.
Really.
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
Right!
Piece of fucking cake.
Where'd Twombley get shot?
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
Open the door. We're late.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ.
Why do they do that?
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
What are you talking about?
It's not that.
What then?
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
How about a Big Mac?
No.
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
I want to go home.
I know.
You're a policeman.
I want to go home.
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
You mean Twombley?
Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
Yeah. A few things.
Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.
How you holding up, Wade?
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
Could be.
Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
You don't mean that.
Okay.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
What way?
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
This is nuts.
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
Just do it.
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
Twombley.
You think Jack shot him?
Well, it was an accident.
The night before the shooting.
What happened?
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Yeah, I guess.
Get some sleep.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
Want to know what I think happened?
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
A hunting accident is perfect.
Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Do you want to go on?
Wade, are you alright?
You're not them.
We don't know that --
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
Have you always had it?
Yes.
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
I guess you could say that.
Bathroom?
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
Are you all right?
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
Love was never our problem.
I don't know how you put up with him.
I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
What the hell is this?
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.
What's the bad news?
Pops!
Can't this thing go any faster?
She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
Pops, you're a genius!
A cold? Of course.
Thanks, Pops.
Oh shit, we're late.
Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
Nice meeting you.
We're loose!
I don't hear no fat lady.
How're we doing?
Where's it headed?
He's trying to impress you.
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
I know, you like to make a big entrance.
How to kiss ass.
How was...  ...the ballet?
I'm not leaving.
People are dying out there. I don't think exciting is the word I'd choose to describe it!
Marcus!  I did it!
It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
I'll tell him we'll take two.
Where?
Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.
It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. Alexandretta? Hmmm...
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
Yes. Now we know.
What about you?
I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.  Have a look over here. This might interest you.
That was our assessment as well.
Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
We already have. Your father is the man who's disappeared.
Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
In that case, I permit you.
It would make me very happy.
Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
Find something?
Bingo.
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
Don't wander off.
It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
What do you know about this place?
So it did.
I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
Dad!
Don't call me that, please.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
Through the library?
I knew it. And the tomb of Sir Richard?
Found it.
Well, what was left of him.
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
If only I could have been with you.
There were rats, Dad.
They want my diary.
You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?
Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??
Don't worry. He won't.
She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
How did you she was a Nazi?
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
Try and burn through the ropes.
I ought to tell you something.
And the chair.
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
What about Marcus?
Marcus would agree with me.
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
I was the next man.
Ships that pass in the night...
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
I don't know. We'll find out.
It happens to me all the time.
He's busy being dead.
This is intolerable!
This could be close.
The penitent man. The penitent...
What did you find, Dad?
I'm doing what I can.
Ready.
Uh-huh.
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
This is your last chance.
All right! Where's my father
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
Why?
Hi, honey.
Instant rice...?
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
Yes, baby?
You better take a good look! Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak?
You got a deal.
We gotta hook up.
When's your deadline?
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
Yeah. Catch you later.
These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters...
Because he has to reveal it in a court of law. It's on record, it's out. It's no secret anymore. So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate? It's out in the world...
Shit...
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night...  Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...
...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of Kools to the world.  Sealed doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
Before you go...
A gun? Yes.
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
His veracity was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
How are you, Jim?
Jim, it's Lowell.
I didn't want to leave it there...
I don't understand.
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
...taping?  What are you taping?
I'm doing an interview.
Where should I wash them?
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
Yes.
Oh, someone took a poll? Are all things Canadian boring...?
Hello? Yeah...
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye.
What?!
What are you and Mike going to do?
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
Oh, my God.
Jeff! Wake the fuck up! Everybody is on the line here. If they can catch you in a lie, they can paint everything with that brush. Do you understand? Everything you say!
One thing I've learned as
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
Yeah.
Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
What's this?
So, is everything okay?
Lowell!
I'm with Don on this.
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
I think it was a disgrace.
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
Oh, lots.
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
That Canada story? Still interest you?
Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.
How do you like your coffee? Black?
Like what? Your sign?
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
Far as you go where?
Should I just take the documents now?
...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out!
I'm Lowell Bergman. We spoke on the phone, remember?
Why am I gonna mention your name?
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
Seven dwarfs?
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
You okay?
It's obvious, isn't it?
What did you get us?
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
Yes.
I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
They do this with impunity!
Jeff...
They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it.
Good. But Jeff...
...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really -- I didn't know how to do that...
You attract a crowd.
I don't know what to do.
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within...
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
She sued you for back payments of child support?
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
That's not the point.
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
You try and have a good time.
Yeah. Yeah, I will.
No, you can.  Tell him to get on the fucking phone!
Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
A delivery device for nicotine.
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
You're gonna get your fix...
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
Most certainly.
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
I would bet on it.
The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers...
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
I'll not going without my family.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
She's a big girl.  She understands.
I miss you. And I miss her.
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
White House Situation room.
Where's my family?
You wanna knock of f?
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
My god. I think that was a MiG.
Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
Right.
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
Recall any names?
Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
There were no phone records.
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
What's the other name?
Did he pay you for this?
Go on, Willie.
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
I think we should have him in for a little talk.
Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
Where you going, boss?
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
Yeah.
We're hooked. Hove into position.
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
What did they...
You still questioning any Cubans?
It leads farther than that.
What do you mean?
Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays for keeps...  I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.  I taught him everything.  A wanna be
What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
I see.  And where did you drive?
Would you say this Leon was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?
Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator.
And Shaw?
Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it.
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
But who meets him when he gets off the boat in New York in June '62?
Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
I don't believe it!
Aren't you being a little hard?
No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?
I'm not sure I understand.
No.  Never heard of him.
A Willie O'Keefe?
Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street.  Do you recall that?
Who?
No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
Please answer the question.
Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.
I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
Come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold.  What are you doing in here?
Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
Honey, you all right?
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  He only had two more Russian words right than wrong.  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid trial! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
They killed him, honey.
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
Boss, the President's been shot.  In Dallas.  Five minutes ago.
One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
Post Office.
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster, Eladio del Valle, in Miami.  I gotta get him in, boss.  I need more men - I can't even pull the teams to watch Ferrie... This is our case!
The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it.
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
Who do you think changed the parade route?
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
Who?
We need him back.
I just plain don't trust him anymore.
Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
Jim Garrison?
Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
Does it matter?  Another technician. But an interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza.  You know how I know?  That picture of yours.  The hoboes... you never looked deep enough...
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
It never did.
I keep thinking of that day, Tuesday the 26th, the day after they buried Kennedy, L.B.J. was signing the memorandum on Vietnam with Ambassador Lodge.
More than ten years.
Yet on November 22, 1963 - the day of the President's murder - our police report says he pistol-whipped you with a .357 Magnum.  But the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill. Here, take a look at it.  Now, does a simple argument over phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you?
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Was he there often?
Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled a lot of the training.  There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans got trained, too.  Nazi types. Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the craziest.
And Oswald?
There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair - I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know - like a society guy.  Can't remember his name.  Oswald was with him.
The assassination, Jack?
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
Thanks.
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
You were there for me.
You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
Uh-huh.
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
Look, man, I know I owe you --
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
You got a good lawyer?
Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont Livingston?
What's going on?
She wants to make a deal.
She almost sounds scared.
What's she want?
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away.  Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?
What's this?
That's my diet shit.
Help us do what?
Bet you're happy to be working again.
What's her name?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
In cash.
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
Same as you. Ten thousand.
It was the other guy who busted me.
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
I am. Have a seat.
Black's fine.
Thanks, but I have my own now.
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
It looks nice.
Uh-huh.
'76?
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
What?... What'd you do?
Why?
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
How'd you feel about it?
I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
For now. These relationships never last too long.
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
She's adorable. But I had to end it.
Bring the money in and they follow it?
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
He was here?
I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
Has he hinted around?
Why?
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
That's my job.
I'm not sure you answered my question.
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
I believe I said I'd be tempted.
What if I've figured a way?
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
He's already there.
Less ten percent.
I hesitated taking that much.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
I didn't use you, Max.
Where're you going?
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
If I don't cooperate?
Not every day?
Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.
Oh, Miss Brown?
We'll just be a minute.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
What are you doing?
The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...
A Broadway shopping bag.
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.
I'm sure that was the idea.
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
Uh-huh.
You said that the last time.
Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
I never have. It's not my money.
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
Yes. All those things are true.
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
There was a guy with Melanie?
Not in the fitting room.
We had our agent on you. She sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy. The white guy takes the shopping bag and they go.
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
If it'll make you happy.
I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie.
I thought you were watching him.
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
Sure.
Killian's.
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
How long you been with Ordell?
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
What were you two fighting about?
Jackie?
Thanks.
Now be careful with that bag. You don't want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store.
Yeah.
You positive about that? You weren't nervous and let something slip by mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I just gotta know.
Yeah?
They told me.
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
You thought right... Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga.
Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.
Yeah?
All your money's in Mexico.
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
Didja tell 'em anything else?
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
That's a good idea.
If you want.
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
I can do that.
Who?
I need to talk to you alone.
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither.  No answer?
So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car -- mission accomplished.
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
He's just repeating shit he overheard. He ain't any more a gun expert than I am.
When did you get out of jail?
Two months shy of four years.
What for?
Yeah, there's another hit left.
You okay?
You're fourteen years old here?
No.
That's a picture of me in Japan.
About five years ago.
Yeah.
That's not what I'm saying at all.  You know where he went?
You live with him.
Uh-huh?
I'm carrying it.
Then what?
Guess where I am?
I know you don't know. I said guess.
An employee I had to let go.
So we on the same page then?
I follow.
I didn't look like a bum.
Can I ask you about Melanie?
She believed you?
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
It's Louis.
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
Not now, pick me up.
So what, you left her there.
So you're sure she's dead.
In the chest and stomach.
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
Fuck you for asking me that.
That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
Or...  ...she gave it to somebody else first, before Melanie went in the dressing room.
How can I help you?
That's Winston. He works here.
Yeah.
It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
Ten thousand sounds high.
Beaumont Livingston.
Livingston, huh?
Do you know what he's on probation for?
They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
House.
Hey, Max.
Yes.
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
Beaumont worked for you.
Was she?
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
I got it. I just don't got it on me.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
They decided to no-file. Tell me where you are and I'll bring you your money.
Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.
What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?
She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
Uh-huh.
You expect me to just walk in there?
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
No.
You better be, motherfucker.
It's Beaumont.
'Ola!
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
I was gonna tell you...
Hope you don't mind keeping him company.
No problem.
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
No! The army did this to me! They've done something to my brain.  Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm not dead! I want my family!
No! Oh God.
I see.
What do you want from me?
Oh, terrific.
Hello.
What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
I'm hanging up.
Hey, wait!
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
Tell your mother.
Now what?
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
No. Not really ...
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
A bit.
What did she have to say?
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
Louis, you're a life saver.
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
What? By myself?
You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
I'm walking, aren't I?
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean.  I need to know about ... demons.
No.  I see them.
I need your insight, your intuition.
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
Jacob Singer.
Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
Gee, thanks a lot.
Where is the lamp?
Where to?
What do you mean?
You up?
Your kid dropped it off.
Who? Jed?
They're weird names.
I must have been out of my head.
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so what's his name brought 'em over on his way to school.
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
Gabe.
Wait. Don't.
I don't like things that make you cry.
I just want to look ...
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not.  It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Where are we?
Where?
Where's Della? Bring her here?
It's gone to the top.
Get your clothes off!
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't stand around waiting.
I can't do it.
Don't gimme that.
Here. I'll do it.
You're right here, Jake. You just rest.  The doctor said you had a virus. That's what they say when they don't know what it is. You can't do anything for a week. He says you gotta recuperate.  Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman made you some chicken soup. It'll warm you up.
What?
While you were in the shower.
He said you didn't have one.
Jezzie?
Stay away from me, Jez.
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
I can do anything I want.
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
Bullshit!
Please.
Where have they gone?
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street.  Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
Jake, what is it?
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Where have they gone?
This isn't happening.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
WHO ARE YOU?
You know who I am.
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
Like it was yesterday.
A couple days later they decided to use the Ladder, on one test battalion. Yours. Just in an infintessimal dose in the food supply, to prove its effectiveness in the field. They were sure your unit would have the highest kill ratio in the whole goddamn offensive. And you did, too. But not the way they tnought.
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil, but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
I think I'm falling asleep.
Well that's good to know.
I would have stayed there if I could.
Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.
I don't know what to say.
They're awfully heavy.
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
Last night! They were as real as you are!
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have put on twenty pounds.
Count 'em on one hand.
Why the hell we drivin' here?
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
That black car?
I don't know.
Yeah.
They've been followin' me. They're comin' outta the walls. I don't trust anyone. I'm not even sure I trust you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.
Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
They're waitin' for me, that's why.
You've seen them?
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams.
Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
Died?
Pour it in.
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down.  See what your son did?
You got it.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
This is Matt Hooper...
It's my charter. My party.
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
You got it?
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
The bilge pumps. There --
That's it! Radio in for help!
Have to pump her steady, s'all.
No!
He's trying to sink us!
'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.
Give me 30 years, I'll get it.
Don't be silly - You're going to make summer better for them...
I don't want to depend on these things, y'know - sometimes you can weaken your eyes.
It's three feet deep, Martin
Michael! Come inside!
Thank you.
Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.
Tell 'em I went fishin'!
Do I need any more authority?
So we should set out a smorgasbord?
Only 24 hours!
Sure he is.
Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
What kind of a shark did you say it was?
We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have.
I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...
I don't know if I can do that without a...
I was acting in the town's best interests...
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?
Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.
What's that?
Florida license plate.
No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
What do we do?
Only one sure way to find him -- offer him a little something to eat. Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, anything. They can sense it miles away. If he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him.  It's a good time, too. They're night feeders...
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
Sometimes.  Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
We gotta get back soon...
What happened?
I want to check something. Hold my feet.
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
Be careful, for chrissake.
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up.
I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...
What day is this?
And nobody else saw her in the water?
That wasn't funny.
So would I. Come on in.
I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
You're leaving?
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
This is Quint, Missus.
What have you got there, Lenny?
Who've you told this to, Lenny?
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
C'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say.
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.
It ain't a Big Mac.  The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation.
I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark.
At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.
Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on --  Slower! Throttle back ---
No way! He can't!
Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that.
...Pardon?
Karma.
Not really.
Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
He whips you?
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
Yeah.
Carryin' a gun.
...Anything else?
That's not true!
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
Early, you are so sweet.
Geez, they look kinda weird.
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
Turkey's are real smart. Smarter than most people think...
What do you need a Bible for?
Best kind.
Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
Forget it.
This the book your writing?
How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
You wanna hear mine?
Yeah?
Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
Nah... how much money have you got?
No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
If you say so.
Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
...and?
Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake.
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
So how's it going?
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
Take your time.
Look again!
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
Brian get him out of the car. Next gas station either he leaves or I do!
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
What are you going to do?
What about you?
I don't know.
Not yet.
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
...Need a hand with those bags?
No.
...never?
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
...You know what I mean?
I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job.
What kind of problem?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
All you gotta do is look at the map.
His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
Are you crazy?
Maybe you should.
I wouldn't know.
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
Homesearchers.
We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
I was at the beach.
You're a lying bastard!
Sit down!
Run it down.
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
What was your relationship with her?
Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
You alright?
What is it?
I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
Maybe you're reaching a bit?  I think Sanderson should be in on this. There's a reason why the killer's calling him.
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
Remember eventually revenge is carefully...  Have you tired juxtaposing the words?
Just a second.  Hello?
Why her?
Just like who?
Huxley's quote also says, his play is always fair and just.
What word did you leave last night?
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
I've figured out the message.
Yes?
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
I know where you are.
This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead.  You can't undo it.
I know, but this isn't going to bring her back.
Of course not.
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
Never mind.  He died two years ago.
You might not have done it had you known.
the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus; Alan; the guy could be a psychopath.
They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
Of course.
How long she been dead?
That means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message.
I'm busy right now.
No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
But we heard him.
Kathy?
Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have.  All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night.  They're all the same type.  All moved into their homes within the last three months -- and all of them found their homes through Homesearchers.
As large as castles.
What does that mean?
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
Okay.  Why don't you go out there. We'll check in with you later.
Do you know how she found the apartment?
Didn't you tell me that Debi Rutlege had just moved into her place also?
Could you tell me where you were last night?
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
To my room and then I went for a walk.
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
I still don't see how he could be playing chess against you.  There's only enough grids on the map to be half a board.
That's all he needs.  He's making the moves.  It's an opening.  I just can't remember the name.  Okay, it's a game.  He's starting it, so he moves first.  He's white.  e2-e4.
That's got to be it.
Answer the question.
Mate in five.
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called Principals and Tactics by Anton Berger.
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
Uh huh.
Yes.
but you enjoy being the stronger one? you like the control.
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
It is.
What are you looking for?
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
In a way.
This isn't a game.
Of course.
Why?
No -- I'm not involved.  And I plan on keeping it that way.
How could you?  Unless you were there.
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
No.
Because I think he's wrong.
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
What is this?
I just don't want to fight with you.
You've got to face the things you feel.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
You can turn everything around so easily.  This is not just another game, is it?
What do you want on it?
Nothing.
Then why are you backing up?
--admit what?  That I was right about you in the steam room?  That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want?  Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
Where's the note?
Can I come in?
The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have.  I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.
That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
But I do.
Why?
This letter.  I've never opened it.
If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be.  He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.
Of course not.
I got lucky.
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
What's that man's name?
Give me his name, I will mail him.
...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.
...What?
Yes.
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
130... 140...
Whoever.
Good! First shot!
The yellow and pink.
It's incredible! How did you do it?
I killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... I left nothing for you!
...I'm going to kiss you.
What?
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
...OK.  I love you anyway.
I think.
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
Risky business, isn't it?
Poor darling, and then?
Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you?  Are you OK?
Yes.
I don't know... Getting far away, the two of us, for example...  And forgetting all this...
I don't know... Five minutes.
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
Fine...
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
Can I sit on the stairways now?
I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
William Harcourt?
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
Man, somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George?
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
Did you talk to him?
Back off, George.
Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
Who is he?
Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
Sticking out of his ass... yeah! See, that's what makes it a joke. There's like a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture. Here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer.  Nada, huh?
Well, let's roll, George.
Nothing.
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
No, George -- you're missing the point.  The drug is evidence.  We need to have the evidence, ya know?
Tell me about it...
How do I look?
No... two.
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
How can I go?
I'll cover you!  Get outta there!!
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
Have they located my daughter yet?
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.
Okay.
Listen.
I like to remember things my own way.
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
What is?
Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner.
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.
Over there.
Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
Hello.
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
Pete?
Okay.
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
What deal?
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
How'd it happen, Alice?
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
So, should I call Andy?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
You killed him.
Where's the bathroom?
Dick Laurent?
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.
Okay. Thanks.
Yeah.
Hey.
But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
But my head...
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
What do you mean? You're where right now?
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
I thought I'd stay home and read.
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
Maybe.
What night?
From the club. You didn't answer.
What's that? Another tape?
Yes, I just found it on the step.
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
On the tape! There was something else on the tape.
No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember.
Why would anyone do something like this?
It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
What job?
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
Was there?
No... of course not.
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!!
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
What?
Hello.
Okay.
What's goin' on?
I missed you.
Yeah?...
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
I don't know.
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
You still care about me?
You really don't remember?
It was weird...
I don't want to talk about it...
Where'd you come from?
What's the BITCH'S name?!
Sheila... Stop...
Sorry to disappoint you.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
What's he scanning for?
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
We got problems.
The corner!  Ready?
Can you see?
Can you see the balloon man?
Anderton, leave.
I have to find out what happened to my life.  Agatha.  I'm not going to kill the man.  I don't even know him.
Please, I want to go back...
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
She died?
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.
How do I find the --
The nano... what?
You the sentry?
About seventeen days.
... Graveyard shift.
Don't worry, Lamar.
Don't apologize, John.
Tuck in your shirt.
I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
I go running down there.
I'm fine, Lamar.
Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
John.  Please.  Listen to me --
I'm not getting halo'd.
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
We can't grab it...
Run the subscription list...
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
Go ahead.
Sir?
Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.
That was easy.
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
Really?  You've never been inside?
If it's a question of authority.
Just a nickname.
Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
I agree.  The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human.  It always is.  Thank you for the tour, Wally.
You set me up...
She was looking right at me.
Just go to the beginning!
That's right.
She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
Rufus, play it back...
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you, Sean.
Wanna hear something funny?
I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
I forgive you...
Do you know who I am?
His name was Sean.  Six years ago. Francis pool.
Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
Who made you do this?
Kill me!
Tell me!
You're not gonna kill me...
Something wrong?
I'm... not... a... killer.
It's game time.
You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening.
Not if I stay away from him.
I can't help you.  No one can.  The Precogs are never wrong.
What?
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
The system would collapse.
Do you?  Really?
What safe place is that?
And then walk out.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
The female.
We didn't miss anything.
I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
You look great.
John said something about him being set up because he found out about her.
Stand back.
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
None of your damn business.
He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?
Not quite.
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
So there is a way to fool the system?
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
People have gotten the message.  Gum?
I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
Because of the nature of murder.  There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another.
There's thousands of units like this one.
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
He's trying to prove his innocence.
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
How many?
Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
Have you been there recently?
What was it then?
But there's still the other two.
Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
Yeah. Take it.
So?
So, wait, you're from where?
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
I don't get it. What do you do?
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
No more.
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
Mommy's not home?
So, what kind of gig is this?
No. What kind of bachelor party?
Oh, please.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
With what?
Goodbye, Bobby.
Take her.
There's no touching.
I don't get it.
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
5-5-1.
I'm serious. Humping sheetrock and driving on weekends got to get to you after a while. Might be nice to buy your lady something. All it takes is one fight.
What's up? Jess ready?
C'mon girl. Eat up.
Excuse --
What's that?
Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
Yeah?
Where's Ricky?
Ricky's taken care of.
You bet the ponies?
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
A million. Easy.
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
They were out of line --
Not driving Jess, you won't.
It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.
No.
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
I got a way we make everybody happy.
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
You vouch for him?
You want --
Not you. I want Ricky to answer.
Yes. Goodbye.
What drill?
We get it. We're sorry.
What's the plan?
Looks like it stung him.
Nah.
Where is the Soho Grand?
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
What are you saying?
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
I'll page you.
Yeah. I know the number.
Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number.
I know the number.
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.'
Shhh...
Come on, man. Not with the owners here.
What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
You wanna go right now?
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
I'm not painting the fu --, I'm not painting the ashtray. And frogs aren't purple.
Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore.
Holy shit. Can you believe this?
See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Yeah. He said that's our account with the car service.
Who you calling?
Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.
What are you doing?
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
Nothing.
How'd they know who you were?
They asked who it was.
Don't even start.
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
You know this guy?
Yeah. What vibe?
He woulda told us right?
Thanks.
Where do you think you're going?
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
What the fuck's going on?
What the hell did you do?
What's up?
Where?
We're not getting whacked.
It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's telling us the plan.
What are you doing.
Nothing, man.
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
I'm pretty sure we do.
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
Wanna bet?
Why?
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
I don't want to take any more chances.
Hey, boys.
Fuck...
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
Show me. Show me where it says Screech on the fucking list.
Ugh...
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
They cut the power.
Where do you live?
It means you got a gun?
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
Why? What I say bad?
You really in trouble?
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
I hear the China Club is a laugh.
That shouldn't be a problem.
I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.
Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
Is it nice?
So whenever we want...
dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK.
That money is your per diem.
Don't worry. I get it.
So, wait, what are we dropping off?
It's a digestif.
No...
When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming?
And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
A rose by any other name would --
I'll get it.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
What about me?
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
They're dead.
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
Did one of those things grow inside her?
No, it's different, honey.
Yes.  A little girl.
No. It would be convenient, but no.
Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood.
My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
[I have a friend there.]
Let's see how the relationship develops. I'll call you in the AM. Thanks.
Where does he live?
You don't, I'll call you. Oh! I have a tape recording that I am sure will interest you.
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
[So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]
[What is his name?]
[How does it work?]
[Don't lie to me.]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
[Drive.]
[Who are you?]
[Where do I find him?]
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[I want you.]
[Lucky how?]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico City International. Bring a bunch of cash... about 5K. I'm going to need it.
So how's business?
Yeah, right...
You been working?
Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
You did something on impulse?
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
What are you doing here?
I came to visit you.
I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
Maybe...
Two days gone. They're negotiating a ransom.
Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.
Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
The United States.
No.
I'm a bargain.
That's right.
Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
You're fast.
Do you think he'll come back?
Yes. Actually, he was driving me crazy.
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
I don't talk to them much. Does he have a name?
You need to practice.
Why do you ask?
You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.
I guess that really does make me a hard case.
Yeah. Two or three.
There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
Could I stop you?
The world of our children. How dare they?
You're American.
So are you.
Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
How are you getting along with Pinta?
No.
It makes it all seem so serious.
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
Sorry.
Jordan!
Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back.
This is Mr. Creasy.
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
Samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I feel totally exposed.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
[Is that good or bad?]
[I know this. Your point?]
[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
[You only fuck me to get information.]
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
And they took that away.
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
Phoney Frank? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
You want me to go up with you?
Good. I don't want to be late.
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
Tell me what's wrong.
I need to get something straight first.
You want a convertible or hardtop?
...a car.
What's the suspect's name?
Anything on Korda so far?
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
If you say so.
Like it had to be done.
So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
You don't like New York?
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
I'm not sure.
Well, if I have to, I have to.
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
Do you really?
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
No.
I can't do that.
So what do I say to this guy?
You could say something like,  Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out.
It's against my nature.
What's the first commandment?
Why?
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
I'm just practicing my lying.
Yeah, first and second.
We lost.
You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.
He's cutting down the visibility.
Damnit!
You're crazy.
Pull up alongside.
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
That's a chance I gotta take.
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
Which apartment?
Is the hostage injured?
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
Please. I'm begging you.
Maybe you should be.
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
And it's hard to get.
What do you think?
When?
There is?
And you think he'll...
Use your imagination.
Do it!
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
Hmm?
A deeper level?
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the M word.
You crazy? With all those people around?
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
Where's the damn wire?!
What?
Are you going to make this hard for me?
Define concern.
Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
You let us worry about that.
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
Okay, I think I could swing that.
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
The car is part of the deal.
What happened to your Trans Am?
I can't do that.
Are these yours?
But I want to make some changes. Get Krista in here right away won't you?
The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is?
What?
Sorry.
Huh?
What?
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
I...
I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
No.
There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
Good luck.
Could I see some identification, sir?
Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.
Yes, yes, I understand.
Good.
Yes, I'm listening.
Where did you get these? Who are you?
I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.
Are you 'fucking with me!?
Me?
What...?
How should I...?
You killed him.
I kill her - and you kill me.
Keep your voice down.
Even if you don't, Her Security men will.
Let me talk to her again.
You don't understand. I'm going to trust you. And you have to trust me.
Okay...
Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
You never saw your Mom and me kiss like that?
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?
He's doing it for you. No matter what anybody tells you, no matter who they are, he's doing it for you, because he loves you.
I'm just an accountant.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
You remember me?
Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
Oh, man...
Please. Something is going to happen...
What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
Cover your mouth.
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
Kill the Governor.
I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
Don't think I won't.
You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing.
Thanks for the tip.
Don't be like that. Think of me as the Moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs.
Oh, we'll have to do better than that.
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Do it!
Just put her on.
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
What'd I say?  What? What? What? What?
Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
You, Preacher?
Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
And I won't never tell about the money.
Just fine.
Hide us Uncle Birdie! He's a-comin' with his knife!
It's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
Sshhh! He's in there.
Who?
A man of the Cloth?
What can we do, Mother?
I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
Not before one of 'em knifed a farmer and stole his horse. Never caught the gypsies nor the horse.
Come on!
He lied!
You go set down by the River.
Get along with you.
You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
Ah.
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
Just a man.  Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
Where's Mom?
Yes, I reckon that's it.
No, that's just it. No.
John?
John, where are we g --
Are we goin' home, John?
Up river.
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
I'll see to Pearl.
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
Nothin'!
It -- she --
What?
Under the stone in the floor.
Nothin'.
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
No.
Mister Powell?
Didn't you have no inkling?
Maybe she's just run off on a spree.
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
How you been, Ellis?
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
I am older.
Want a cup?
That man that shot you died in prison.
You don't know what he thinks.
When did he die?
Nineteen zero and nine.
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
Not the one thing. I used to think I could at least some way put things right. I don't feel that way no more.
Yessir. It may be that. In a nutshell.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
Hard to believe.
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
Would you tell me if you had?
Some pretty bad people.
He won't neither. He never has.
Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
Yes ma'am?
The old boy shot by the highway?
Uh-huh.
Llewelyn Moss?
You figure him for a dope runner?
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
I don't know...
Gun out and up.
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.
Probably must be.
...Now that's aggravating.
Sheriff?
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
Yessir. Wasn't none.
Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.
Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.
Okay.
You gonna drive out there?
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
I mean, would you care to join me.
It ain't even three years we been married.
Not like that. Not like you say.
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
What's in the satchel?
Llewelyn!
What? Quit hollerin'.
Just keep it up.
Goin' out.
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
Odessa.
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
Why all the way to Del Rio?
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
Yes ma'am?
I shall return.
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
She'll be all right.
You go to hell.
Where does he work?
I need you to step out of the car, sir.
...Where's the transponder?
...You getting anything on this?
You know she won't be there.
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
So what're you goin' up there for.
No. Do you?
Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't goin' to have to look for me at all.
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
What way would that be?
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
With what?
Well... I need to see about closin'.
...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
Well... I need to close now --
Yes I do.
This was my wife's father's place. Originally.
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
Yes.
Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
Uh-huh. Double ought.
Never mind.  I want a tent.
Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em.
Yessir. I understand that.
I'm sorry.
Waitin' for my wife.
...But that won't last.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
I'm retired.
I'm a welder.
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
I don't mean braze.
I didn't say braze.
Yeah. I was in Nam.
So was I.
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
Why would he go to Odessa?
To kill your wife.
No. You don't.
No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
I don't know.
No sir.
Yes sir. Two tours.
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
Why don't you go back to doing something you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts column?  I'll take a refill there, Betty...
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
It wasn't a woman.
Did you send anyone out there?
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
You better handle what's in this garbage can first.
Yeah?
...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
A woman can write a check.
'S just a theory... just 'cause I'm thinking it don't mean I like it.
Oww, the arm, the arm!
That's right, you have the right to remain silent.
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
Oh. How come?
Do you know why I'm here?
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
This is really awkward...
I'd rather not...
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
I don't think I am.
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
Yes, ma'am.
Umm... yes. Back home.
I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
Uh-huh. No, we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday, right? I'll have another one next year...
Maroon.  I stole it.
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Are you and Larry happy?
All the time...
Well, you are.
Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright?
What are you talking about?
But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.
The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --
No, Del.
He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
Lyla's very nice.
No, I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.  Was this before Leslie? Before us?...
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
So, call me when you --
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
What?
Or the vitamins? Or the...?
Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
They're new to us...
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
Yes.
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
You're in serious danger!
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
I left my husband two days ago.
Really?
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
No. Loma Vista.
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
Like Rome?
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
I married a car salesman.
You're hurting him!!
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
You don't sound like you're from here.
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
Oh, he does that.  It's this silly game he plays. Half the people who know him call him George.
What are you doing?
I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on...
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
Your husband?!
Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
Okay, okay, look, ummm... Let's just talk a little first and you'll feel better, I promise.
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
If we're for real?
Are you kidding me? What's to like?
What do you mean?
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
Like what?
I... I don't know...
Relax, we brought the cash.
That is so right.
We don't know which Buick, do we?
What 'look'?
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
It's not here. Let's go.
What the hell was that, another statement?
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
I hope you're right...
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
I know that.
Well, I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and I'd be on my way to the Keys. On my boat, RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!! Re-ti red!
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
I said, 'No.' N-O.
Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
Well... I think I saw her soul.
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
What doesn't?
I never said that I believed...
You need to remember who you're talking to...
Wesley...
Who's this?
What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
What'd you get her?
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
I don't know, George...
I'll think about it.
I said I'll think about it.
Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch? Remember?
What the hell's going on?
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
David Ravell.
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
I see.  Did Chloe testify?
Huh?
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
No problem.
She didn't.
There is not one thing funny here.
Stop it!  Stop it!
Yes.
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
I can't.
One.  Squeeze.
Two.  Squeeze harder.
I can't just...
Are you okay?
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?
Are you gonna open the safe?
She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid!
She better.
The kid in here.  The other two when we come out.
Not that one.
NOT THAT ONE?!
Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
Keep your voice down.
Fourteen business days.  Escrow is always business days.
I mean, right?  Isn't it?
This is insane.  I'm outta here.
Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?
Where did you get this clown?
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
Different tables.
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
And we're never getting in.
Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.
Don't!
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
What is this shit you're talking all of a sudden?  You're a bus driver, Homes
We're leaving.
The hell we are.
Could you slow down a little?  Or we could wait for the car...
How many more do we have after this?
I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?
No, Edgar Allen.
He's going down.
PANIC ROOM!
Different phone line, I never hooked it up!
I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
Yeah.
What we want is in that room.
Say fuck.
Get the fuck out of my house.
Oh, please.
Give me a break.
To prove he wasn't chicken.
On the floor!  Get on the floor!
We're never getting out of here.
Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.
Call Dad!
He won't even know who it was.
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
Stop it.
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
What if I spazz out?
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan.  At least, I used to.
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
Am I really gonna have my own room?
Yaay!
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
But don't you dare say that.
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
I'm not tired!
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night.
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
Well, maybe I----
What?
Nice.
I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one.
The one that goes into the woods--sure.
Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
I can hardly read these.
My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
Yes.
Going to tell Ellie?
Seems like you told me about a promise you made--
Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know?
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
Is there quicksand?
It's funny, all right.
Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
This time I mean it.
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
Don't worry about that.
Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!
No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.
What?
Well...a touch of the flu...
Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just--
I'm thinking about going to bed.
I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
It's beautiful!
I think it's rather extraordinary.
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die.
You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
Thank you, Louis.
I got eggs down here!
I'm going to try to do better.
You're doing fine.
You better get going, hon.
This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.
That's what they call a family problem.
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
I'll bet it's been done.
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
You think I made all this up?
until yesterday morning.
Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
Not yet.
The Thorwalds -- at six in the morning?
Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
If possible -- both.
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
Give him evidence.
A detective's nightmare.
Ever get an answer?
You think he's getting out of here?
Like what?
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
Like an old hambone?
In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
Where?
I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
Did you get my note?
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
Lisa Fremont.
Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
Can you see her tramping around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank?  If only she was ordinary.
People have different emotional levels that --
When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it.
How did you know!
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
Isn't he a salesman?
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
Smart girl.
Smart? She'll be arrested!
Unless he's dumber than I think, he won't wait 'til his lease is up.
I got twenty or so in my purse. Give me what you've got.
When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
What would you think of starting off with dinner at the 21?
You have, perhaps, an ambulance outside?
I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.
Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the 21 for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change.
You mean leave the magazine?
That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard?
Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.
If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
You might have to, if you went with me. Ever try to keep warm in a C-54, at fifteen thousand feet, at twenty below zero?
Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch.
Three.
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.
You mean goodnight.
I mean what I said.
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
Nothing, thank heaven.
Do you think I consider this recreation?
A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
What's the apartment house number?
All right -- but what's he doing now?
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
Not yet!
Women aren't that unpredictable.
Still -- those witnesses.
I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him. He doesn't sound like much of a detective.
Don't rush me. We have all night.
Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
That's a suitcase?
A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact, but ample enough.
From his landlord -- once a month.
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
I do?
The same.
Who was the trunk addressed to?
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
I'll rephrase the question.
Do you like it?
It could be -- the knife, and the saw.
Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
Chelsea 2-5598.
Gabriel, what are you doing!
What are you doing here?!
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
Don't hurt him...
You promised me!
He wants the money.
All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
Gabriel!
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Yeah.
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
No, hey, I like your coat --
Do that again.
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Not bad. Just regular.  You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.
Yes it was all you --
Then he shoulda signed his name.
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies.
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.
...the truck driver...
He didn't find Nick's letters, did he.
You told him about Nick's letters.
I love you!
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
Gabriel!
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
Gabriel and his guys. What's the last place they robbed?
They've never done a robbery?
We? What we...
So does it look a lot different?
Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now.
I'm almost done.
If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!
You... you don't know me --
No, you can't --
Who are you now.
You what...
I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
Yes!
I never worked at no casino.
What?
Samantha.
Her brother.
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
Hey.
The hell you don't.
Christmas... Eve...
I did.
This isn't the Tomahawk.
What the fuck are you talking about.
Bring back some memories, Nick?
Do I get a country-western name?
Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
What'd you tell that casino manager?
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
What's the code?
Uh... they change it every month. I wouldn't know.  If there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. You gotta draw 'em out.
NO.
You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.
You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --
Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
Ash?
Ash?
Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move.
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
Not with you.
What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
Yeah.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.
Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
Me and her got a connection.  Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking.
She's using a new perfume.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
Thought you hate your old man.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
Don't move, Rudy!
GUARD! GUARD!
GUARD!!!
Tell Ashley... I...
She set them up. All of them.
And you set me up.
Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.
How'd you know I'd do it.
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
You gave them me.
I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
You ain't dying, he is.
Where was she from, Compton?
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
Really? Who's your P.O.?
We were set up, the cops were waiting for us.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
I don't know, but somebody did.
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
This better not be some Freddy joke.
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
The Milwaukee Brewers?
Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
What?
It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
Mr. Brown?
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
Who's your parole officer?
Never ceases to amaze me. Fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there, slits some old woman's throat for twenty- five cents. Fuckin' nigger gets Doris Day as a parole officer. But a good fella like you gets stuck with a ball-bustin' prick.
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda -
I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.
Give me this fucking thing.
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
Nope.
Aren't you?
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
Why?
Correct.
You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
As opposed to good?
You really think we were set up?
What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said No thank you, and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. But it's never Thai stick. And I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin' money!
What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
No real people?
Uh-uh, just cops.
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
I got 'em, all right?
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
So what is it?
I think he's just passed out.
You gotta idea, spit it out.
Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
I don't know anybody.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
Well, he knows a little about me.
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long.
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
I told ya he'd be pissed.
This is what he was doin'.
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women.
There's a slight difference.
It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
Who is this?
Alright, I'll try...  Cocksucker. That's what she calls me.
What did you just say?
No, I don't.
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE!
NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
I've been waitin' for you Miss Gibson. I want you to know I've decided to take your case.
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse   -- used a phony health inspector's badge  they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.
You think my sister is there?
You can't tell.
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
It's the last door at the end of this hall.
You could go and open the door.
It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety.
About forty-five dollars.
But tell me --
How's Miss Jacqueline?
I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
Redi's all right.
She's a pretty good sort.
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
She showed me a drawing.
We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
A man would look anywhere for her, Mary. There is something exciting and unforgettable about her - something you never get hold of - something that keeps a man following after her.
Weren't you afraid?
But you do believe me?
I saw him on the floor. He was cut -  --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him  white  and the men holding him up between them.
Drink your milk.
I won't do it again. We're friends. I'll never order you about again.
A job?
You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
What brought you down here, Greg?
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -
Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
Please - I can't explain things like this to your right ear.
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.
She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.
It will all be over in such a little while, Jacqueline, and everything will be all right again. Drink your coffee.
Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.
I'm going to find your sister.
It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
Well?
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
Do you think he knows about this?
Let her know what?
That you love Mary.
She'll have to know some time.
Yes. I was going to tell you to look into your own heart -- do you really want to find your sister?
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- your food won't digest
I want you to look for Jacqueline.
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.
I don't think that's so revealing.
I don't know.
I'm at sea, Jason.
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
My window - - through which I see the world.
It's not a searchlight  it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince - not stars --
I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said - it fits in with what I saw - she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
And Gregory -- he loves her.
He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
I can't find Gregory. I've been trying to find him.
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
They may have been friends of hers.
I hate people who try to peddle comfort. But,Mary, you shouldn't mourn for Jacqueline. Life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind. It's better this way.
Bella Romari	If I were not seated, I would embrace you in three movements like a sonata.  Ah, my wonderful one. Fly with me tonight. We will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies.
I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
But why come to me?
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet 	one as a detective.
I should like people to read what I've written.
Tell me where Jacqueline is - we've got to find her.
Tell me, why this sudden desire to publish  to awaken like Byron and find yourself famous.
I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.
They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez - this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.
You know where she is?
Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.
I don't know.
I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst.
I can imagine. But you did say you came to me as my friend --that you were concerned for me.
Mrs. Redi, there's one thing -with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?
Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
Please.
What did he say?
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
What are you thinking about?
It makes me feel better.
You love walks.
I'm here.
Clear for what?
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
Curse and stuff.
You want him coming in the house next time?
Yes, it was.
It's noise.
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
How can you say that?
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
What's furry, furry rabbit?
Ray Reddy's house.
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar. Your grandma said, No. He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it.
From what?
It's getting stronger.
That's good enough for me.
Graham.
Don't.
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
I have some upstairs.
It's still making the noises. It's broken.
It's old Morgan.
Morgan?
Who wrote this book?
Dad.
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
They win.
What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something?
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Stop crying!
Don't yell at her!
You're scaring your sister.
I can't even imagine.
Did someone save me?
It's the strangest thing Father.
Sounds like a virus.
Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.
Is anything missing?
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
Why not?
It's like War of the Worlds.
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
On a lot of lithium?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
I know. Stop it.
Nice?
You like it there, don't you?
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
This is Dorsia?
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
Take it off.
Patrick?
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
Really?
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
It's not that nice.
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
Hi. Pat Bateman.
I forgot your name.
No.
Everybody's rich.
He's good-looking.
You saw that on T.V., Cole?
Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying.  I don't draw like that anymore.
I guess they don't.
Yeah, Private Kinney needed to get back safe to take care of her.
Where should I look then, Cole?
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
You said the s word.
Are you using minoxidil?
What about Mrs. Marschal?
She died a long time ago.
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
Something I want?
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
Cats?
When they get mad, it gets cold.
I don't know, Cole.
Don't fail me.
Dr. Crowe?
Are you wigging out?
What happened?
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
You believe now?
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
I definitely won't.
You were great in the play, Cole.
They're right here.
Oh.
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
Did you move the bumble bee pendant?
So who moved it?
Yes, I am.
We never really shared one.
You know that accident up there?
Yeah.
A lady. She died.
Yes.
They?
Dead people.
Dead people?
You see ghosts, Cole?
What are you thinking, Momma?
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
Cole, please stop.
They used to hang people here.
You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
Stuttering Stanley!
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
Let's say today, we make it your business.
Slut.
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
Sure. What do you want to know.
Who then, Jeremiah?? -- Who?!
The audience!
It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? What about fucking dinner?
How does it feel, Keith?
I bet if he were still alive, he'd like to watch.
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
You never had trouble communicating before.
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
-- You're not making sense!! What Scarecrow?
Mac... let's get out of here.
I almost thought for a second...
Second verse!
What'll we do?
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Why not, you stupid bastard?
Lucky, I guess.
What? CARRUTHERS  I'll call you.
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
And a very bad gamble.
Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.
Yeah, but the Untouchables took down Capone. Heller got shot and killed. The bad guys beat him. Worse, Sparazza walked.
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters F.B.I. in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
Wait a minute, what other agent?  What other agent?
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
New card. What do you think?
You're sure?
I'm not doing cocaine.
-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.
I dunno... Cinnamon roll?
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
I am. Yeah.
Fifty grand gouge. South shore hayseeds, this is why I never play Tahoe, or redneck Reno...
Ask me a question.
So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks.
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.
Here. Sit.   Please.
-- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
...Does he know?
Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --
Don't, I'll drink it.
...Yeah, fifty-three.
I don't see it like that at all.
Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
How are we on time...?
I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been.
A Fed? Like FBI?
You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?
Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I want you t'tell me straight up, since I got my suspicions and y'know I ain't one t'talk circles... you gay?
What!?
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm working girls.
I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
...What are they doin' right now...?
Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
I DON'T KNOW!
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
Ye-es, Je-an?
Who?
Detective Donald KIMBALL?
Hello, Win.
It's called solid... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.
Occasionally.
I've never seen anyone killed before.
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
Queens... You know Queens?
My father founded a music school there.  The Milton Gregory School.
Not too sure about that.
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
I'll come with you.
He said he'd kill me.
Right.  How could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key...?
Hmm...
They're kind of fuzzy.
Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow.
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
Yeah.  It was.
No dog.
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
I'll miss you, Mike...
Sleep good.
Claire?
Open the door, will you?
Stop being nuts!
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
I don't know you...
You told her?
Oh God, that's great!
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
Do you dance?
Pretty bad.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
Everyone's all right...?
Yeah.  It's all over.
I like your coat.
Just putting in an appearance then.
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- let it go away!!
Take my advice, don't buy any...
What are you talking about?
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
It's twenty bucks in the bank.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
You didn't give them a name.
They know me.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
Why?
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
Where'd you get the tie?
Bought it.
She took you shopping for a tie?
I had to follow her to a store.
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
What're you talking about --
I'm sorry.
I'm not saying it's your fault.
What did you do tonight?
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
What's the difference?
El?  I'm sorry.  I do love you.  And you are a lady.  I have so much respect...
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.
He'll live through it.  They all live through it.  What a world, huh?
I'm all right.
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
It should've been me...
Koontz!  I need you guys!
Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug!  I got a 'choice' at all.
Not Koontz.
No, sir...
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
Interesting.
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
Scrambled eggs surprise?
Lay back, Mack!!  What's this lay back
God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!
Just lay back
Forget it.
What's that?
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
Nice threads Dad.
Shooting?
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
I don't think she can sing, either.
Here you go, Pete.
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
What, want a glass?
You stop him?
Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?
Oh, sure.
Cause if you get in a bind--
I know.
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
What's in there?
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
Don't be pitiful.
Mm-hmm.
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
Now tell me you love me.
Yeah--
Can I get a word in edgewise?
Would you cool it already?
Fine.
Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
A spider.  Eight legs.
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
Some things you should say anyway.
I-- uh--
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
I hate--
Back to the lab.  Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
I suppose.
Flash, Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself Flash.
I'd never admit that.
Patrick? I can't hear you.
That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
Well, no.
Oh, God, I forgot to--
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
I am old enough to--
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
The record--
It'll shut itself off.
Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't.
See?  You big dullard.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
I'll try. Thanks.
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
Bonkers.
I'm not so happy myself.
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?
Uh huh?
She's from...France.
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
You're at Paul Owen s.
Paul Owen.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
Coffee?
No, I'm okay.
KIMBALL.
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
Understandable.  Lime?
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
Who do you ask?
I know. I'm sorry.
Would you rather I not smoke?
When is it expected back?
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
Are any of them inhabited?
Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
How well did you know him?
That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more human- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
What do you mean...Yale thing?
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
I hope so, sir.
Perhaps.  Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems.
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
Do you remember him?
Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.
Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
What's the Nexus?
It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
What?
You could say that.
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
The earth just opens up and swallows people.
What do you want?
I was ordered to by the Captain.
Well, now that we're all aboard8A  Number One, bring the ship before the wind.  Let's see what's out there.
No. Thank you.
How is that possible?
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.
Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...
Nothing for me.  I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-
The thought had crossed my mind.
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
I mean they want to get caught.
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
Calm yourself, Bones.
You did great, Bones... Just great.
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
What did you see, Chekov?
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
Scotty...?
Not really.
I went wrong.
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
... Fascinating.
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
But... How could they have evolved so quickly...?
We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.
I have already made one transmission too many...
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
Why?
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
And how many have paid the price for your impatience? How many have died? How much damage have you done... And what is yet to come?
I still don't...
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
Do you have an explanation?
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
Great, yes, I'd like that.
None that I can detect, sir.
Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas.  Be tolerant.
Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.
The doors, Mr. Scott!
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
Saavik... Is... David with you?
This Vulcan -- is he alive?
He is not himself -- but he lives. He is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.
Only one thing, Sir... Get him off this planet... His aging is part of what's going on around us...
What? What are you saying?
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
. He will remain always as he is.
Yes, yes, Spock...
You saved the ship, Spock. You saved us all. Don't you remember?!
She's to be decommissioned.
The word, sir?
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
And?
Yes.
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
Yes.
With some on the planet...
What about surface life signs...?
Come on!
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?
Will you be able to handle that...?
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
Torpedoes coming in -- !
But, why?
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
I will speak with you alone, Kirk.
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
... Yes...
... The needs of the few...
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
Sarek!... What if he melded with someone else?!
Bones!...
What must I do?
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
What about Spock?
What I have done, I had to do.
Physician, heal thyself.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Thank you.
And who am I hiding from?
Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think.
Ah.
I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't.
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
It's...it's...all right.
Oh well, you know.
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
Where they went. Saavik.
Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
Well, don't have kittens. Genesis is going to work. They'll remember  you in a wreath with Newton, Einstein, Surak...
Does that about do it?
Who --
I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military --
Mother, go back!
So are we, it looks like.
We encoded four minutes --
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
It was just words.
I was wrong about you. And I'm sorry.
Is that what you came here to say?
Mainly.  And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.
The Admiral's son.
Oh, I believe it.
What are you looking at?
No, Owen.
I take your point. Stand by to receive our transmission.
I'm going down to the station.
Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
He'll die -- !
Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
The word is given: warp speed.
Is it over?
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your protg's first rare -- a trifle emotional --
Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this.
None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.
Yes, we've been through death and life together.
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
To be sure, Captain.
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
I would not presume to debate you.
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
Gentlemen, this isn't --
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And why?
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
Best we could do in two hours.
Uh oh.
Scotty, can we make it inside?
Steady as you go...
He's intelligent, but not experienced. His pattern indicates two dimensional thinking...
Spock!
The ship -- out of danger?
Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within one hour your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range.
You may ask, Lieutenant.
I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff.
That was a little joke.
Yes.
HURRY.
There is no such regulation.
Indeterminate life signs.
How?
But the damage report -- we were immobilized...
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
They just don't want us going in there.
Mr. Saavik, all stop.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
I really must thank you.
I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
Visual.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...
No way. You have this -- destiny.
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
Aye, sir.
Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
Aye, sir.
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
You lied.
I exaggerated.
We're not gonna let it.
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire.  'Not saying it makes sense.
I know, I know.
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
It was a hate crime.
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business? It's like they know what every kid's doing.
Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
...Different?
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
Just shut up?
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
You have warp capability?
Why?
Deceive us?
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
We can hold them off a long time... once we get there...  But they will not make it easy to get there...
Jak'tahla?
This way!
You've brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders... just as they were once expelled. Except Ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide.
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
You look beautiful.
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
The mighty Federation could learn a few things from this village...
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
I am better.
Don't you ever get tired?
Why not...?
No... I want to stay with you...
I have to go home now.
Milo?
Don't we have any chopsticks?
To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
Is it safe to move her?
Hello, Data...
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
From the mission...
Great.
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
Incomplete, I might add.
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
It is over.
What kind of concerns?
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
You're not finished here?
Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
There's nothing further to be gained from this...
Do you know how to disable the injector?
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that clich about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
I don't think he knows how.
When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment...
Implants bothering you?
... had regenerated.
It's our only way out of here, Mister Nara.
We're through running from these bastards.
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it...
No, we're here to... rescue them.
I am. I am, sir.
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
Yes sir.
He's activated a transport inhibitor.
Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...
Sir, inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance... if we don't release him, he may destroy both vessels...
I'm not letting go of him.
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...
You need a haircut, Commander.
Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...
... Population three hundred million...
Say the greeting again...
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
What are they interested in...?
You're in luck... it says here they've taken women from several races as indentured servants.
Come in.  Hi.
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
I never kissed you with a beard before.
Montana.  Energize.
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
You think they're still up there?
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again...
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
Where?
We're tearing this place apart looking for them... but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the files...so far, nothing.
You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
Altitude fifty kilometers...
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
One minute to warp threshold...
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
We're crossing the threshold!
Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
Invasion.
There is no invasion...
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
Thank God this plate was already fixed.
You're lying.
What makes you say that?
Are you always sucha good judge of character?
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
Some.
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
Why?
Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
Data, set a course for that vortex.
Steady as she goes.
Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?
Worf... torpedo... now!
They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
We're still in Earth orbit.
On screen.
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
No, sir.
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
You would? Wow. When would we come?  'Think he hung up.
What?
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
Computer -- thermal enhancement.
Agreed. Options?
The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation.
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll...
Worf to Bridge.
Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
That's the question -
Uh, Jim...
Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
Can you - ?
Thanks...
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
I didn't mean this future.
When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --
Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
This is fun...
No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself.
Okay. I'm Gary.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
Are you carrying a surgeon?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.
Have you saved patients as barely alive as he was?
I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
...Do I?
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
The drink WAS served...
There... were no other ships in the sector.
That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, Captain James Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you, Captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.
Yes.
For insubordination.
And you were obeying or disobeying orders the night you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I know what you mean...
Uhura, monitor!
How's it going?
Who else?
She's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that.
She's here - somewhere.
Then all we've got is a neutron radiation surge - and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes...
You tell them, Lieutenant.
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
Isn't it about time you became something else?
There's gotta be a way out of this place...
Where do we come in?
Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. Being obsessive isn't a crime. It's a character trait.
Me?
WE volunteered?
I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
What the -
According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
So, that's it..
Azetbur has agreed to meet the Federation at a undisclosed location to continue her father's work... the conspirators obviously intend to try again...
The Commander is an old friend of yours.
I heard what happened.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn.
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
You've been coming in early.
You must have faith.
What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
Even logic must give way to physics. Gravity hadn't been restored by the time they escaped. Without their boots they would not have stayed on the Klingon transporter pads.
I believe you. Please...
I think  not.
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
Nevertheless.
That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.
Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.
They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
Thank you, Mr. Scott. We were to return to spacedock, the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear.
Aye, aye, sir.
I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
Can you remember our father?
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
No. I must deactivate you.
Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
You're working late.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
Is he very much like you were?
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
Can you describe it, Deanna?
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
And this makes you sad?
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
To new worlds...
Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
Mister Worf, accompany Data please.
I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
Sorry, sir.
Good work. The download?
Aye, sir... This way.
It would appear so.
Yes, sir.
Can you open the shuttlebay doors?
Well then... only one way to go.
You could've handwritten it.
Oh, that's right. You're clueless.
Fire!
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
Divert power and compensate.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
Emergency force fields are holding.
The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.
With pleasure, Captain.
Counselor.
You're speaking of emotional investment?
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
How can you be certain?
Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful.
Maybe we should all get on it.
Do you have life support?
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
Deanna, on my mark.
Aye, sir.
Number One.  You have the bridge.
New Praetor?
Understood.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
No!
Just do what I'm asking!
On my way. Please notify Commander Riker.
The Praetor's power has always been the Romulan fleet. They must be behind him.
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
She's a predator.
Not very chatty.
Away team. Transporter room four.
He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.
Sir?
Strength in numbers?
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to 
The honor was mine. Captain Riker.
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
What happened?
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
Yes. The eyes have it.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
You don't trust me.
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
Looking up at the stars.
In time.
Hello, Jean Luc.
I was lonely...
You're not Reman.
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
Please.
Don't you think it's time to surrender? I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces. Why should the rest of your crew have to die?
On my way.
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
My God...
Got out of my other commitment.
My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
How long?
Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop.
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
And?
I came this far alone ...
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
And when I return... you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect!
Cool!
Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
Did you wanna be alone?
Then and now.  But not right now.
That's great. I -- didn't know.
Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
Superconducting QUantum Interference Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's gonna be a test.
Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
My God.
'We might as well make the best of it.'
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
I just got to talk to you for one second.
Hmm?
No, Lenny.
You have to go.  I mean it.
Tonight.
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
Damn right.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
Tell me.
Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
You think Tran killed her?
Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
That's not sayin' much.
Naw.  She won't call me.
I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.
Hey, Iris, you okay?
Shutup a second!
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
You should feel like shit.
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
Faith OK?
I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
Whattya mean?
Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
Certainly not at my happy home.
He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
Where's Faith?
You just did.
What about 60 Minutes.
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001.
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
So there never was a death squad.
Naawww.
This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always bring you choice.
Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
What?
Who was just here?
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  GE joins Outpost in new venture
Charm.
They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
Driving Mr. Lenny.
Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
How close are you?
You will not live to see the morning.
That would be no.
Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here.  D'you mind?
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
Rams... that's football, right?
We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
You mean -- break in?
I don't know --
And gives it to you.
Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.
And what about the guy that was following me?
OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
Jesus, Mace!
Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
Those two guys were cops.
Tell me.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
It was a tough call.
Why?
Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
I guess.
Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
Gary.
No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
There's more to this whole thing than you think.
Thank God.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into 
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
This isn't in our database?
I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
I'm on my way.
What does the Manager say?
Let's take a look.
Winona.
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
Just an observer.
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
I'm hesitant to...
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
You knew the arm slash was not Zorro.
I understand.
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
The Academy, then CIIAC.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
How long have you been downtown?
Five months. I love it.
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
The man knew how to dress.
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
And one other thing.
What's this country coming to?
Me too.  Make any headway with Zorro?
Latitude 47 degrees.
Wait a second. He knows I know.
I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
Because you asked him to, stupid.
Intra-Agency fraternizing.
I've been thinking about this.
Does Koessler ask about me?
He's called a couple times.
Jesus.
You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs.
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
Maybe we should back off a bit.
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
Start killing people for real?
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.
What's going on?
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
I'd be real careful if I were you.
I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
But it was your idea: use Zero
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
I've got to take a piss.
Turn around. Stretch your arms over the seat.
Yes, sir.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
So you went underground?
The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
I already have an employer.
What?!
Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
Lead the way, Murman.
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
Let's talk about Zero.
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Jesus, Teddy.
I met this girl.
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
How far is Amarillo?
She's a programmer?
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
You owe the Don a service.  He has no doubt that you will repay it.
Go back to your house and wait for me...
Yeah.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
Maybe I can help.
I'm going to finish school.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
You wanted me to be your son.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
Things went badly in Palermo?
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.
Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
Was there a definite proposal?
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
Well it's war!  We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop had Genco, who do I have?  Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday, we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be sore.
Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
What was that?
Mama, no.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?
I've never seen anything like it.
I told you I had a lot of relatives.
Michael, what are those men doing?
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
Who is he?
Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business.  They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did.
I told you you wouldn't like him.
My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.
Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
Hello...this is Long Distance.  I have a call from New Hampshire.  Mr. Michael Corleone.  One moment please.
No.
OK.
I don't think so either.  I better go.
Wake me up when you come to bed?
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
I'm busy.
Don't ask me.
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
How's Mom?
Good.  She's been through it before. Me too.  You were too young to know about it.  You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
Theresa.
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
How can you be sure?
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
To the city.
Probably a year...
Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
You straightened my brother out?
How do you do.
Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
Hi Tom.
Did you speak to my father?
Shut up.
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
Say again?
You know, a primer.
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
Bird!
Good afternoon!
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
Could we sail to Venice?
No! I've got more than one shirt!
Now your signature.  Not Dickie. Your signature.
Without the glasses you're not even ugly.  I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
I love how responsible you are. My Dad should make you Chief Accountant or something. Let me buy you a jacket. There's a great place when we get to Rome, Batistoni.
Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
Freddie?
I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you...
He's downstairs.
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
What are you talking about?
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
I wanted to tell you my plan.
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
I love Marge.
Sure -- I know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with Marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a -- and now you're getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive me... you're lying to Marge then getting married to her, you're knocking up Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've got to play drums, which is it, Dickie, what do you really play?
Ciao bello.  Don't you want to fuck every woman you see. Just once.
Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.
Dickie?
No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?
Hardly.
I'm well, thank you.
I think it might hurt her to know.
I just don't believe that!
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
Okay.
I hope she never knows.
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.
I never said that!
Bird. That's jazz.
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
Where's Dickie?
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
How long's he staying for?
He hates being confronted.
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
You were going to Venice.
Did he kill Freddie?
Marge, when did you get here?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
I was looking forward to seeing him.
He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
He's having an early night.
Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
I found Dickie's rings.
What?
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
Shut up! Shut up!
Why do you have Dickie's rings?
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
What?
We think he's had a change of heart.  So we should be celebrating.
Golly. Who's paying for this?
I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall.
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.
Show me the other one again.  I like them both.
Beating you away.
They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
So -- are you travelling under R?
Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
A ragione. A ragione.
Will we see you later?
Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you.
What rumour?
I've been backpacking.
I don't know how to translate that.  E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un...
Tell him I have a fiance, Dickie has a fiance and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
He says so many fiances.
He's already angry, I don't think --
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
I keep wanting to do that -- fling open the door -- let the light in, clean everything out. If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything out... starting with myself... the thing is, Peter, if...
I'll fix some drinks.
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
What do you mean lied about who you are?
And don't forget. I have the key.
You're such a liar...
Dickie Greenleaf?
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?
My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiance.
Even your fiance...?
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.
31 people.
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
Absolutely.
Tomorrow.
Huh?
Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
Well, we're all working tonight.
I can believe that.
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
That's really something.
I know. I could have picked you up.
No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable.
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
He'll, what else can I do with it all?
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
What are you doing?
I forgot to get the Coca-Cola.
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
Well... mostly...
But... Betsy...
What about the record?
Can I call you?
Well, I hope he wins.
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
Sure.
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
Oh, Tom, please.
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
This is gotta be a game, right?
Ouch!
No, why?
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
With the other hand, right?
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
Betsy, come over here a moment.
Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
No, I'm serious, really...
Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said Look
The cops and company raise hell they find out.
I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher...
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
I have.
All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
Why you hang around with them greasers?
It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long.  That cigarette burns out, your time is up.
Easy.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
What's your real name?
That's a nice name.
That's what you think.
Why? Who are you?
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
You want to make it like this?
I musta been stoned.
Don't you understand anything?
Well tomorrow noon there's a... I got a...
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
Where is home?
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
Do I look like a narc?
Yeah.
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
You just gonna leave 'em?
You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
How?
Sure you don't want to come with me?
You don't have to.
Have you tried the telephone?
So whatja do now?
Also clean.
Education?
No.
Well then check back tomorrow.
You would, huh?
Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
So howsit?
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
The taxi life, you mean.
Yeah.
Travis, look, I dig it. Let me explain. You choose a certain way of life. You live it. It becomes what you are. I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab. I guess that's the way I want it.  You see, that must be what I am.
Thanks.
Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
Motor oil?
It's all I could think of.
I'll go.
Wait.
It's about time.
The cell, Mason.
Partners?
Partners.
You knew?  All this time?
God's speed.
What's that?  Mason?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
No, not really.
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
If you have some, I'd...
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
What do you mean?
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Then what was it?
Because she was afraid.
I don't understand.
She already has a daughter.
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
Yes.
Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Take them.
Yes?
Well, I suppose...
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie.
I don't know, honey.
Where does he live?
Mmmm.
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
D'you want me to order one for you?
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
Young woman cut herself.
Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
You did say birds?
Seven o'clock, same as usual.
I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
How long have you known her?
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
I know, Mother.
That's a chance we have to take.
When?
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
What happens when we run out of wood?
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
We won't be here.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
What?
Do I sound foolish to you?
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
And if you don't?
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
Would you like me to go for her?
I couldn't ask you to.
Did you close the door?
What are we going to do about it, Al?
All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
Well, where did he go?
Lovebirds, sir?
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
Well... yes, sir, there are.
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Some of them are.
We never met in court or anyplace else.
I didn't break that window!
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
It deliberately came down at you -- you're bleeding...
What's that?
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
Do you practice here?
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
How do you know Annie?
We... we went to school together. College.
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?
I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
With... with Annie, of course.
I'm sure.
How does Mother know what I like to do?
Oh. That. Rome.
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.
No.
But you tore it up.
Do you expect me to believe...?
What do you want ?
I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
Cheers.
What do you do?
Helping travelers.
Yes.
Do you want some mustard with this?
It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
Hear!
You have nothing to lose but your feathers.
It's so damn quiet out there.
It was like that yesterday.
What do you mean?
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
I'm frightened, Mitch.
Don't let's take any chances.
How long have they been gathering there?
Do you want to try your father again?
Where are they heading?
How about you?
I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
Mitch...
Wait here. Don't move.
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
Can we turn back?
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address.
There we are!
I have no idea.
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie.
Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, please?  Yes, I'll wait.
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by.
What were the crows after at the school?
To...  To kill them.
No one called it a war!
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
I think we're in trouble. I don't know how or why this started, but I know it's here and I know we'd be crazy to ignore it.
But can't you give me any idea?
It's not the failure. I feel that MacFarlane has taught me nothing. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
MacFarlane
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
He's not home.
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
I remember her.
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.
Gray killed her.
I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
I just saw Gray.  What was he laughing at?
He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
Don't be a fool.  One can't begin and then stop -- and because that entry of the girl's body is in your hand, you'll do as I say. As for me, I'll tend to Gray.
Gray -- I'm rid of him --
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
He has the camera!  He took the movie!
This is not a woman!
Why do you want the white horse to bid you good-day?
But you'll have to stand great pain, Georgina.  Greater pain than you ever dreamed of in the worst time of your sickness.  Do you want it that much?
A student.  I'm studying under Dr. MacFarlane -- that is, I've been studying until today --
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
Hear him?  Did you ever see the lads play knife?
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
But what makes a thought start?
You don't know and you'll never know or understand, Toddy. Not from me or from Knox would you learn those things. Look --
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
No, I'm not afraid. Tell! Shout it from the housetops!  And remember this -- they hanged Burke -- they mobbed Hare -- but Dr. Knox is living like a gentleman in London.
I have no wish for a rope cravat. I've never liked the smell of hemp, so I'll bid you good night, Doctor MacFarlane.
Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
You are not to set foot in here again, Gray, for business or any other reason. And you're going out now!
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
I've drunk enough tonight.
You're getting old, Gray, and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of Edinburgh --
What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
I would make you rich.
Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --
But still you may have heard the peddlers of verse cry out their names on the streets.
How long after that was the paralysis complete?
See here, child, when you have this pain in your back, where is it?
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
I'm not heartless, Ma'am.  I have every sympathy for you and for the little girl, but if I were to consent to every operation brought to me, I'd have no time for teaching -- and that's a great responsibility upon me, Ma'am -- a great responsibility.
You're daft.  What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.
No great lady will ever take my place?
I'll get him.
I'm looking for my friends.
You sent them. I had no choice.
You're wrong.
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
I was hoping you'd find out.
Big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator?  All possibilities. Although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator.
You lied at my trial.
Wrong. Answer.
What did they give you?
We're going to play a little game called Who's got the Scar.
Good thing in a situation like this.
No! Why are you haunting me?
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
It's not. I can't take it.
In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
Erin!
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
What? What is it?
I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.
What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
I leave that in your hands.
Yes -- of course.
I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps there's some mistake.
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
We can scare him more than he can scare us.
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
No -- I'm afraid not.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
Thank you... Have you any news?
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
I've got a good lock on my door.  And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight.
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
I don't care about the rest of the world!
I'm not going to marry anybody.
Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
Naturally I think so.
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--
What happened?
It won't work.
It must be twelve-thirty.
Yes -- Just exactly.
Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
He'll have you -- and Tom.
I'm sorry.
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
Is it worth anything?
That's right.
You don't.
He's my brother.
They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
Zero.
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
Star?...
So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
Hey, take it easy.
Where's Star, David?!
Leave him alone.
Look.
You're almost one of us now, Michael.
Phoenix actually and these Bullwinkle and...
I can't do that!
I thought they'd be in coffins.
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation.  We've all been through enough.  Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.
When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.
I thought we were goin' into town.
Who, Laddie?
Laddie... you can still remember. You can still remember home.
Promise me you'll keep it that way.  You're not like the others, Laddie.  You're like me.  I can still remember, too.
For everything.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
I'll pass.
Michael, are you still in bed?
I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
Okay?
What about Oleg?
What's your cut?  How much?
No.  No way.
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
Can't.  Got plans of my own.
Michael!...
Can we go now, huh? LUCY Maybe later.  Grandpa's expecting us.
Tell them to get something to eat.
Not that poor.
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
Lights out, Sam.
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
What's wrong?  Tell me.
Where's Michael?
He's already gone to bed.
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
Must be a circuit breaker.
What did you say?
No, I'm not...
Lucy.
a job.
Not impressed, are you?
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
Oh, right.  I always gets those two confused.
This looks terrific, Lucy.
... death ...
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy.  One big happy family.  My boys... and yours.
Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
It's you I was after all along, Lucy.  To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
Did you want to talk to me?
Okay.  Talk.
If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
I guess you're new around here.
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
Because I love you...
You've got to put this on.
Huh?
That's okay, Mom.  I can see it later.  I'll help you unload.
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
This room is mine.
I was here first.
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
How long have I been here?
Go away.
Did you spill something?
The bottoms of your feet are covered with salt.
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
No.  On the phone.
Don't bother.
What happened, Michael!?
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
So I'm still ...
What??
It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
Who are you calling?
Huh?...
Maybe dinner.
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Happens all the time, man.  They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it... Chariots of the Gods, man... They practically own South America.  I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew...
What?
Don't walk behind me.
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
What's it going to do, being a plant?
Now hold on, you dumb...
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
No.  Just let him freeze out there.
I said where?  Where'd you go?!
What's happening?
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
Where's the other half?
We got morphine, don't we.
Gee, thanks!
Well, who says I want you going with me?!
Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us.  Norris... you stay here...  Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  And everybody watch whoever you're with.  Real close.
You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
You been made, MacReady.
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
Mr. John Steed, please.
Smart S.O.B.  He put it together piece by piece.
Then we'll never make it.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
As you see.
Really -- what happened in 1922?
Well, who's got access to it?
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
Palmer, how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on?
Damn if I won't.
Looks good.
Four!
Blair.  He's gone berserk.
And that was enough?
We going to make it?
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
Can you think of any other tests?
We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.
Then who wins?
Couldn't be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
What for?
So what do you make of it?
Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
I resign.
Watch me.
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.
The Institute ... the funding ...
Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
To find out who killed my husband.
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
You.
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
'Our revels now are ended.'
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
Well, what are we gonna do about it now?
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
He's recovering on the third floor.
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.
Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
That's too bad.
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
My business?
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
You sure you know where to find one?
[Beat] You're his son?
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
Because...because you came out and said something you couldn't have possibly have known. You came back and repeated three names...
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
No, we were patients.
How did you come to know their names?
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
Did you know my father?
My father used to talk about you.
You're mad.
It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
You done with your small talk?
Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up 'till today is done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs.
Mom, he just fixed our car.
Such as?
What're those?
What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
I'll never marry you.
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004.
Yeah.
Yes.
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
I have no idea.
You think Lorenson kills you?
How long do we have?
I don't know.
They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed.
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
They're not here.
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
It's Sunday.
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
I didn't. Mother did.
William, you're not making sense.
No, he didn't.
Where are we going?
Ok. Ssh. Rest.
[Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
How?
I still don't either, even after all these years.
You're not crazy.
You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
I was working with a boy named Eugene.
Why would we do that?
You don't understand.
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
What about the world?
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
And how do you know that?
William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
How do you know about Eugene?
You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me.
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
NO! They're not my delusions! Look, just leave my business with Becker to me!
I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
Yeah.
You have nothing to fear, William.
Do you?
Yes indeed. I need protection.
What are you talking about?
I tried to kill my wife.
[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
[Beat] How do you know?
The Jacket.
Why?
'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!
[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
[Beat] Thanks.
I'll manage.
Yes, but he was a cop.
Have you always been a waitress?
[Beat] Why?
Have a good day at work today.
Hon?
Darryl.
Aw, God.
You might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes.
Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
I've been better.
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
Just some young guy.  Around twenty years old.  Dark hair.
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something.
It's him.
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
For a man in my position --
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle named Harlan!
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
Did you get married real young?
Louise, is that you?
Well, I guess I'd better...
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
I am the great and powerful Oz...
I'm a robber.
What?
Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...
I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
All of a piece, really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.  British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by ... aliens.
Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
Wire it to the Western Union in Oklahoma City,
Not yet.
Tell me now.
Call me back.
Peaches.
Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'!
Alright, alright.  I'm sorry.
Why now, Jimmy?
Are you just doin' this to punish me?
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
Yes.
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  Hi.  What'd he say?
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Then what difference does it make if we stop?  Come on.  I never get to do stuff like this.
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
Did he say who?
Well, just relax, will ya.  You're makin' me nervous.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!
It means shut up, Thelma.
I will if they don't send me back.
I'm cash poor.
Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.
Actin' like what?!  How am I supposed to act?  'Scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody's head off!
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
But you think he fools around.
He said Okay
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
He's got a lot to be proud of.
Yup.  That's him goin'.  I love to watch him go.
I won't wait up.
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
I want you to call Darryl.
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
Why not?!
No physical evidence.  We can't prove he did it.  We probably can't even prove he touched you by now.
Alright, Louise!
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
Let's get it over with.
You told that thievin' little shit where we were goin'?!
You're right.
I'm not suggestin' that!  I'm not goin' back.  No matter what happens. So don't worry about me.
You mean now or before?
I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
I can see that.
Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll be darned.  What's he doin' way out here.
Just ignore him.
Okay, Louise... It's okay.
What?
Sorry!
What?
Whatever.
I know.  I know what you mean.  I don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo Show.
Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
Well, let me know when you figure it out.
Me too.  I feel awake.
What?
I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
All this for us?
Then let's not get caught.
You're a good friend.
Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
Barely.
You followed me.
Yes ... ?
And do you trust me?
You don't trust me?
As far as you trust me.
I told Mother I took care of you.
I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...
Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
Yeah.  This way.
You first.
Where are you going?
If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.
What kept you?
-- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.
What does the letter say?
And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
Still a bit chilly ...
I think it's a bad idea.
Then they should speak up.
Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
Not quite.
Our chaperon.
I'll be evacuated with the President.
Busy. But you've got his heart.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.
He was.
Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
Should be here any minute.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
I don't like what's happening.
Fair enough. But Castro's on alert and we're flying attack planes over their sites, on the deck. There's no way for them to know they're carrying cameras, not bombs. They're going to be shot at, plain and simple.
I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple.
Maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. At the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. And at the end of the day, they may end up being right.
Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.
Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
I thought we were staying on the reservation.
Oh, I'm set, Sir. I'm set.
Decontamination -- ?
I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.
You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony.  Has to be kept for four days.
Jesus...
You crashed my file?
Go ahead.
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
Thanks, Cooch.
It may have been Maggie's way of saying get off my ass.
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
You're steppin' on sign.
Bullshit.
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
What did he say?
And...
He also said listen to the water.
Don't be mad. That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.
I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain.
I can't do that,  It's a Rolex.
Red Deer Table, Ray.
Heavy, heavy duty. Taku Wakan. Wanagi Spirits. It's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids. Still don't. Some of the old people say Crazy Horse is buried back there. We have to go Ray. Together. Like his vision.
What you call myths, we call our history.
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
Cuz I'm a skin?
What are you talking about?
I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
Just before we caught Jimmy... I had a dream that I was being chased. And I was running with other people. Old- fashion Indian people. I got shot in the back. Like Leo.
Where was this?
Sorry.
Yeah. Fitful dreams.
Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones.
Jesus. Oil?
1868...
What?
Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear Moon...
They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?
We're going for The Stronghold.
We're in there. We're in there --
Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world.
I desecrated it?
Yellow bird... is gonna sing.
Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
Get up out of the chair, Richard.
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
How the hell do you know?
The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them.
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
Mother and Father know best.
I'm sorry.
What was that?  An accident?
Definitely.
You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato.  The fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet.
Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?  Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right.  She's gonna be Hauser's babe.
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
You're nothing!  You're nobody!  You're a stupid dream.  Well all dreams come to an end.
What the fuck is going on down there?!
If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
Great!  Because, otherwise I'll erase your ass.
Stop fighting and get out.
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
Kill him.
Oh shit....Oh shit...
Two-headed monsters?
Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
What do you want?
I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
Swallow this.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
They sell fake memories.
RekallRekallRekall.  You thinkin' of goin' there?
No shit...
How was your trip to Mars?
You went to Rekall, remember?
Let me buy you a drink.
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
Nobody.
Tell me!
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
There's lots nicer places than Mars.
Well...What do you say?
Some men just tried to kill me!
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
And falling in love?
Implanted.
Bullshit.
O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really.
I didn't know you were so kinky.
Bullshit.
Then I can pull this trigger, and it won't matter.
Doug...Bob McClane.
Okay, you're the boss -- Mars it is.
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
I give up.
Go on.
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!
Let me go!
I think it's still hungry.
I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!
I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.
This is too weird.
I think you better leave.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
I'm not falling for it.
I said get out!
Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.
If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
Jump!
What can I do?
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
Like what?
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
I don't need Kuato for that.
He's lying.
Are you all right?  Are you still you?
What reactor?!
The one in the mine!
It's just up ahead.
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
I gave you?
...Who are you?
What was I doing on Mars?!  Damn!
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
Well, we'll ask around.  Let you know if we hear of anything.
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
I might have an idea...
Well, we can take my truck then.
VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
Could we make it to the mountains?
Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
You're gonna get us hung up.
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
I thought you called it your pecker.  Look, don't make the mistake I made.  Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me?  Here with you.
Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get over to Nestor's.
Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them?
In the past year I must've said a hundred times We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves.  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right now?
I'll call that little bluff.  How close?
Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
You're full of shit.
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
You got that right.
Jesus!  I don't believe this!
Fuck you!
Fifteen lousy bucks.
A man who plans ahead.
Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  They better be fast.
The rifle.
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
Sons of bitches!
Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell you. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really in on something here!
Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.
I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
I think we wait right here.
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
I'm gonna kick his ass!
Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull anything.
Like hell you are.
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
Only if something happens to me.
Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.
It's out last one.  We can't kill them all.
No ties.
Civil?  I'm civil.
Somebody paying you to do this?
She just practically asked you for a date.  What the hell is wrong?!
Burt!  Heather!
Right, geology.  And you have to be Val and Earl.  I've heard all about you.
Around here?  Why would they?
What's it doing?
They're working together, too.
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
I think the ground's getting closer.  I think we do it.  We're gonna save our asses here!
In the kitchen.
Go away. I am not talking to you.
NO! GOD, NO...
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
No.
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
Here he comes.
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
What was?
The stuff we got last night.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
We can do it right here.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
Sorry to hear it.
How come Jack let's you work here?
Say no more.
Code, I've heard a lot about this.
Lil was wearing a sour face.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
What did Gordon's tie mean?
I see. He does talk loud.
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
It's late, Sam.
I think that's a good idea.
I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park.
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
You better dust this place, Sam.
Take a look at this.
May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
When he says, Discussion, how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
Noooo...
Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.
The usual, 9:15.
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
Maybe.
Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?
Laura?
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
Do you want to talk?
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
If I can smoke it.
Donna, you are a muffin.
No, you're the muffin.
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
You mean Fred and Ginger?
If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.
What are you doing?
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
No.
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
Why do you do it, Laura?
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.
I already made you two tapes.
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
Why? It does.
It does matter. We're in love.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
We were supposed to be together.
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
What?
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
See what?
Hiking?
Sex?
Trees?
Hi, honey, how's Donna?
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
Let me see.
A friend from school.
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
Yes.
I was down the street.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.
How do you know what she doesn't like?
Did you see it come down?
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
Well, I did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my Masters degree.
How can you say that when you don't know him!
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
Automobile ignitions are insulated.
We can't go into town - everybody's getting out of there!  I'll fly you over to Pasadena.
You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
Don't you live at home?
A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation...
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
I wonder if they're going through this too...?
Have you got a pocket compass?
A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
Are they sure it's a meteor?  It didn't come down like one.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
The nightmares.
Yes, but...
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
Might as well be, Dylan.  State of the art animatronics enhanced with bio- organic grafting.  Bull tendons, nerve bundles from a Doberman, even half the brain of a homicidal primate was...
No biggie, really.
You get any sleep last night?
Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
Hasn't been another call, has there?
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
Just be careful, okay?
Chase. Hi...
What's up?
Chase, it's Dylan!
Yes.
No.
Does he have to stay here over night?
Is he all right?
...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside.  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
This is going to give you nightmares.
I like this story.
They were safe and could sleep.
The mean old man with the claws.
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
Rex woke me up. He was fighting.
Under my covers.  Kids singing, and way down there, the man...the mean man...
And...what's the man doing?
Home, that's right.
A story?
I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
What...happened?
Freddy, for all I know.
John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  I'm gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me, John?  Please!
Yes?
Yes.
I want to see for myself.
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
Then what is he doing?
How old are you?
Well... Yeah - okay.
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
Bobby Peru grab you now... Hold you tight... Feel everythin' in you now... Stay quiet... Say fuck me and then I'll leave.
Need a hand?
Thought maybe Sparky and Buddy'd taken ya. Come on, I'll drive.
No.
They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?
Ready for another?
Why not?
Lula tell you she's pregnant?
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol.  Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.
You heard from Reggie?
The cobra's waitin' to strike, chica.
Thanks.
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
If your neighbors didn't mind, how'd you get put out of business?
I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.
Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.
Why not? How was the fishin'?
How's that?
I knew this would happen. Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew there'd be trouble. He's just got some kind of influence over her I can't decipher. There's somethin' wild in Lula I don't know where it comes from. You gotta find 'em, Johnnie.
Don't talk down to me, Johnnie Farragut. I know what volition means, and that's why I want Sailor Ripley off the planet! He's pure slime and it's leakin' all over my baby. Maybe you could push him into makin' some kinda move and then kill him dead. You'd only be defendin' yourself, and with his record, nobody'd fuss.
I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos.
I got some news, Marietta. Lula and Sailor been here. They checked out of the Hotel Brazil on Frechman Street yesterday.
Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
What is it, Johnnie?
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
This 'bout the fifth time?
Don't give me no trouble now, Pace, please. This ain't the easiest day in a long time. And what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like? You seen his photo.
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
And?
Pace, your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all.
What brand'd she smoke?
In a fire, as I recall.
I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
You okay, honey?
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
That's good... Now go get yourself a beer.  You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y'all know this one?
That don't seem fair.
It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.
One time - real late - like about two thirty a.m.? She found Dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin' sandwiches in the kitchen.
...are followin' him around.
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
What'd you say to her?
When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind.
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
We got through two states already.
What kinda trash talk is that?
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.
Honey, we're goin' to bed now and it's time to change the subject.
We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this bird into New Orleans.
What's that, peanut?
Huh?
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
I'm goin'.
Who knows, baby?
Just part of life on the road, peanut.
Do me a favor, Sailor? Don't pick up no more hitchers, okay?
I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?
Maybe there's a place we could hear some music. I feel like dancin'. We could ask someone.
We'll find out in a hurry.
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use?
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
Under a hundred.
I can't take no more of this radio...  I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!
You're scarin' me, baby.
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
There's worse places, honey.
Trust me on it.
I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
SAILOR!!!
I don't know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole.
Don't know, but she's gonna bleed all over our car, I'll tell ya that...  Hey... Hello... Girl... You gotta come with us, honey.
Let's get outta here, honey.
Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.
Fan works.
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
Sailor?
Okay, honey, I'll see you later.
You sick?
Yeah?
No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
Love you, too.
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
You been drinkin', huh?
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
I mean tomorrow.
He's the kind liked it.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
What?
You must be my son.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
SAILOR!!!!
Damn!
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
Mama, Sailor's in deep trouble here. I just can't leave him.
Course I am, mama.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
What if I asked you not to?
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
And jus when my baby's out on some Texas road with a killer.
What do you want me to do about it?
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Explain it... I told you.
In the head.
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
Yes.
Yes.
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
No... But...
I'm gonna take your silence as a yes...
Put your shoulders back, I said.
Shhhhhh...  Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now...
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
Please Santos... Where's Johnnie?
...Yes you heard me... Don't ever call back here again.
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
I let her take a shower.
Be gentle.
But Chief?  Over this??
Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!!
You done impressing yourself, ace?
Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.
Nice shot, Lins.
There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
I can't believe you let them do this!
Wasn't up to me.
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
I think you were worried about me.
You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
What are you still wearing that for?
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
What happened?
I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
Hippy, just relax.  You're making the women nervous.
Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!
I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
Chill out, Lindsey!!
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
Try again.
Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.
Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
I don't know, look around.
Son of a bitch!
How?
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
What's the plan?
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
-- He killed people --
Who asked you?
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
How many are there?
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
What's you depth, Cab Three?
Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
I like what you've done with the place.
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
8500 feet, Bud.  Everything okay?
Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.
Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.
In the Field Museum once.
It works.
Sheep don't count.
Yeah? What about Laura --
Why'd you come here, Brian?
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed games?
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
Hey! You don't know me --
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
-- I told you to stay next to me!
Never mind.
Hey.
Hey.
C'mon, let's crawl home.
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
He talked to you Himself?
I can't say.
One of the other Sisters?
Vodka tonic.
Because I'm getting fat.
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
I'm a blimp.
He loves you the way you are.
It's a sin to be fat.
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.
Oh my dear child.
I'm not hungry.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
Yes, of God.
I'm being punished.
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
Say it!
It's not my time of month.
That was the beginning, the night of the conception. That's why she burnt the sheets.
No I don't.
No I'm not.
Let's talk about something else.
What would you like to talk about.
Right now?
Yes.
Often?
At least once a week.
Roll the hose.
Would you like to talk about it?
No. I was sick.
In the middle of all the pain?
Where did the baby come from?
The baby they made up.
Is that where they say it came from... ?
Would you like to ask them?
Anything?
I can't have them any more.
Where do you think babies come from?
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
Like what?
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
Where did you go?
I don't know.
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
Do you?
No.
Why not?  Mmm?
Agnes, did you love your mother?
Why not?
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint...
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
What the child?
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
Sometimes, yes.
Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.
She can't hurt you any more.
She watches... she listens.
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
Yes?
... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
And that you're stupid?
She says my whole body's a mistake.
Oh, yes.
She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
I'm afraid.
Of telling you.
I had a baby.
It came out of me.
Did you know what was going to come out?
Why?
May I open my eyes now?
Yes.
Would you like to tell me?
Will she be angry?
We went to chapel for vespers.
My bed.
A crucifix.
Do you know who put it there?
No.
What do you feel?
Which one?
Who?
Go away, I don't want you here.
Is someone in the room with you?
Yes.
Who?
From the belltower the day she before she died.
So she sent you?
Yes.
I hate him for what he did to me.
Yes.
Who?
You okay?
Yes.
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
H... how?
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
Thanks...
Thanks for the insight.
Just leave me alone, okay?
I'll have a decision by next week.
Marie's dead Mama.
I... I'm Martha, Mama.
No.
Who told you this?
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
Unfiltered.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
Is that normal?
She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
And I am not from the Middle Ages. I know what you are!  I don't want that mind cut open.
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
So, someone else could have done it.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
That's absurd!
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
This was before her pregnancy?
About two years before.
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
How?
Earthquakes?
Was the child full term?
What is it?
Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.
Yes.
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
Do you know what she did to her?
There is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  Lots of dirty little secrets.
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
I knew that after the fact.
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
Stupid woman... and that's all?
And what has that to do with it?
No, it reminds me.
I'd love one.
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
And Saint John would chew tobacco.
Yes I do.
Do you want to become one?
Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth.  No more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles.  Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles.
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you.
Who is he?
You're saying God did it?
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
That's what I have to believe...
There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
I'm concerned about her health.
If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.
This is permission to take her apart.
Where is she?
Was it you?
For what?  An abortion?
I don't know... too late to stop it.
You tied the cord around its neck.
Then she's a liar.
Oh, don't do this!
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
I know.
How do you know?
Anything else?
Shut up!
You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --
You're back.
Thanks for calling.
Really? No kidding.
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
Hey.
How's it going?
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
Uh huh.
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
I was doing my job.
Yeah? And just how much of all this has been doing your job?
Leave Stephen out of this --
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
That's a dumb thing to say.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
I don't have a story.
Where is she?
I wanted to be him. right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
Where are you going?
So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.
Do we have a language barrier here? Glass.
No it couldn't.
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
But the right guess on this is arson.
Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
Did you pull me out?
I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Are you hit?
So, you surviving without me?
What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
Carl?
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
Hey?
Hmm.
What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
you do?with access to records?
And?--And?--
Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
This is terrific work, if you like rejection.
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
I hate both parties.
Who'd you vote for?
'68.
You voted for him.
Go on, go on--
--we will--
I'll be there, goddamn it!
Nothing--I just found out that Jeb Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike freak than I am.  I never like it when the other guy's human...
Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
If he self-destructed.
--'cause I only know four chords--
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
Haldeman.
It's nothing personal, though.
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury.
--We got twenty minutes to deadline--
Here we go...
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?
Good. Just tell him I was here, that I'm sorry I missed him--
You can't.
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
I know where Dwight works.
I didn't do anything wrong.
Chapin did contact you then?
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
The great communicator.
Sorry I hit Jackson.
Speak.
--no--
--there's nothing new in it--
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
You can't keep being his father...
Hey... very tense.
I think.
There's always a later plane.
--you don't really think you're being followed?
You've really got to go.
Just let me get a match.
The ones who could disburse the money.
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
Sloan knew which five, didn't he?
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
So tell me about the Times article.
Something maybe big.
that leaves Haldeman; period.
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
I saw him. he verifies.
--I'm sure--
Electronic surveillance.
Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--
Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?
I have nothing more to say.
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
Go on.
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
melodramatic?  things are past that--remember; these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge city.
Talk? Once, at a gathering, he put his hand over a candle. And he kept it there. He kept it right in the flame until his flesh seared. A woman who was watching asked, What's the trick? And he replied. The trick is not minding.
My turn to keep you waiting.  What's the topic for tonight?
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
What?
I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
You get nothing from me about Haldeman?
Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
And Justice and FBI know all this?
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?
You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  ...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity
I can't sell hints to Simons--  --you called everyone you know?  Call someone you don't know.
Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
Just that on his office wall there's a cartoon with a caption reading, When you've got them by the balls
Hunt is Colson's man--  --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel--  --they both went to Brown University--  --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.
I think we got a White House consultant linked to the bugging.
--listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--
--listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--
A boy or a girl?
--and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.
And old ladies?
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
You don't know... nobody knows...
I need to get in the trunk.
What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
Yeah. Apparently.
AHHHHHHH!
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.
Sure. I can follow that.
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
And who's Claude?
In an underground club? I'd like to see that.
Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
Fan-fucking-tastic?
Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
Roussel? You mean Claude? You're calling Dr. Demento so he can come paint my face again? Fuck that.
Are you okay?
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
What?! He told you? When?
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
What makes you so sure this will work?
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
Shut up! You fucking shut up! What do you want? Huh? What the hell do you want?
You know what. Kill me. Cut out my fucking heart. Go on! Do it!
Really.
What does it say?
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
Psychic awareness. Right.
Yeah?
Terrence and I came down here to do serious work. For centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures mainstream society would not tolerate.
Why the fuck would I do that?
I don't believe we've been introduced.
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus...
That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
Uncle Terrence?
I went to St. Severin church.  Now look -
The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
Uncle Terrence, you're...
Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
Yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws.
Allo?
Andy!
God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
Describe him.
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
Watch the news?
Nah, I musta missed it.
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Nah, why should you?
Pretty.
Hmmmm.
Who says she's a suspect?
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
My folks are.
So they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.
You'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.  Keep this pointed at him if I get preoccupied.
This has nothing to do with your fire.
Six months.
Oh.
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
I was gone, in September, laying traplines.  She went to our cache for some meat.  Got mauled by a bear.  Tore open her skull. -more-
I don't want to talk any more.
Wasn't my intention to hurt Wilder.  I'm telling you the truth.  I liked the man.  I only meant to get loose... to survive. Your cheechako boyfriend better understand that.  Listen, I've got some money put away --
Have you talked to Eric?
He's coming around fine.
What are you doing?
Great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.
Bastards took off, though, didn't they?
I'll go into town with you.
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
I still can't believe I'm being financed by an oil company. Especially when they get a look at these pictures.  Technology in the wilderness; not too pretty.  What's that?
I thought I should check our emergency transmitters.
Not me.  I'm equipped.
Come here...
Let's go.
Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.
Be careful, okay?
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
Yeah.  Maybe so.
A daughter in Oregon.
Surviving is what I know --
Been driving long?
That makes the flight more interesting.
Sounds like professional jealousy.
You got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger?
I'm not gonna carry you out of here.
Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?
I don't plan on dying.
Still quite a hike to Devil's Cauldron.  Days.  A long stretch to go without sleep, my friend.  You can hide behind that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze --
Ice is too thin -- you can see the water moving underneath.
We're not sitting here 'til November.  There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.
Going to be a bit of a challenge with handcuffs on.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
You want to fool yourself about that bullshit job, fine.  Damn shame you have to drag your girlfriend along.  You think a woman like that will be happy making moose stew for a man -more-
Folks come to Alaska for a real short list of reasons:  Money. Adventure.  Solitude.  Those cover most everyone.  But frontiers also draw another type of man.  One with a demon in his gut.  He comes to the edge of the world to face that demon, and lay it to rest.
You don't get it, do you?
How many do you see?
Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
What do you know about people? You live like an animal!  A savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here, as far away from the rest of us as possible.
Don't bet on it.
Maybe...maybe not.  I'll tell you what scares me -- stumbling through life, like an ordinary jerk.  That's why I want to work on the front lines, where what I do means something.  Soon as I got here, I realized my job was bullshit.  Oil company propaganda.  I was ready to leave, then I thought screw it, I'll outsmart them, do the work anyway.  I don't know anymore.  Maybe I am fooling myself.  That's what I'm afraid of most of all.
Hell, I still get a knot in my gut every season, wondering how much longer I can go on.  No 'Home for Retired Trappers' that -more-
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
Emergency transmitter?  What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?
Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
We'll get you to a hospital, soon as we get to Fairbanks.
Look down there, tell me what any of this matters.  Struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. Soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth.  I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
Sure.
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
You don't care enough about Sam to --
What does this matter to you?
Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.
Any idea who could've done it?
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
I'll call it... tails.
Two heads.
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
So you're from around here?
I know just what you mean.  I'm pretty beat myself.
No shit.
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
Yeah.
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
I'd love to sit in that jury.  Send that S.O.B. right to the chair.
That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport.
Bain.  Michael Bain.
How long have you been freelance?
Two years.  Two long fucking years.
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
I know you're going to jump.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say.
Shit.  That sure is a lot of money.
Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?
What?
You think I would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars.
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
How in the fuck do you know that?
Hi.  Up ahead my boss is in that black limo.  We're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them?
No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.
Where are we going?
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
I work for the government.
I'm part of the game, just like you.
The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.
You're one of them, aren't you?
Why?
And you want to use me to get him?
Forget it!
We don't have a choice.
Right.
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
Electra.
No.  Just Electra.
With computers.
Better than playing with yourself.
He was killed.
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
Then you went freelance?
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
Yes.
They become complicated... messy.
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
Where is it?
I wasn't expecting this.  I need to think.
Oh.  What do you think about?
Do you think about the game?
But you've never figured out a way to win.
What happens if you do?
What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
That sounds nice.
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
Here?
Yes.
I know what you are thinking.  I'm not going to disappear, okay?  I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  I got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
How was the beach?
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
Thank you.
You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
What?  What if he brings it with him?
He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
Sounds pretty well figured out.
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
You didn't take it.
I think I got one today.
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
Jesus, if someone had --
Thank you.
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
Did he explain how this happened?
He believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl.  I watched my parents have this big fight, really big.  I thought my mother was going to kill my father. Then they went into their room and made up.  And I watched them make love through the keyhole.
Because, I'll take it.
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
I'm sure you will.
Am I attractive?
Are you attracted to me?
Attraction is a complication?
Yes.
Who was she?
Were you attracted to me right away?
When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
That doesn't sound normal.
Martin.
Martin.
Four minutes.
Okay.
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
Can you tell me about it?
Yes.
Thank you.
Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.
Why not?
I hope not.
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
Taken.
That's exactly what I told myself.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't that funny?  I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one.
And an R.C.
Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
Yeah.
Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.
So am I.
Well, he's gone.
He said not to tell.
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
Can't afford to take chances.
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
Hey.  I'm a professional.
Okay.
I used to throw trash for the City.
You ever had to open it up like that before?
Mmmmm.
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
What for?
No, you're not either.
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
Sure.
He'll say that?
Nothing.
Great.
Something mi trabajo.
You want to go for a ride?
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?
It's your play.
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea.
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
Is that all there is to it?
You know what I think?
But it would hurt.
You don't believe me, see for yourself.
You said that once already... Too late now.
I found a lid. It was laying on the ground over there.
Look at all this junk.
How's he doing?
Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.
I don't know.
Well, I'm not going down there and look.
Yeah.
Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
No.
Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Well, I shouldn't expect miracles, should I?
You smoke Pall Mall?
Boy. I had a feeling today was going to be the day... Helicopter.
He's not coming to take us for a ride, either. Come on, let's make a run for the car.
Have you got a better idea?
I just don't want to go.
What?
Sure.
Well. I'm sorry, sir, but we've got to ask you for it.
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.
Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not just Bill's secretary  Bill and I are... I love. We-
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
What. What don't I understand?
Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.
Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
No, but the whole goddamn  Audrey? Have you ever had to read any of Bill's wrestling scenarios?
Well, usually, they're... simply morality tales. There's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end. In between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect.  Bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type, or a convict. And sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild.  The studio always hated that. Oh, some of the scripts were so... spirited!
You wrote his scripts for him?
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
Garland, it's me.
Well as a matter of fact, I write for the pictures.
No, I  I didn't mean to sound 
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
Nothing, really. Said he was in the insurance business.
Well that's what he said.
He... I'm trying to think... Nothing, really... He... He said he liked Jack Oakie pictures.
Could you come back later?  It's just...  too hot... My head is killing me.
Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.
It's still a little early for me.
Ever act?
I'm a writer. Ted O 
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected 
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
Well not much.
Well what do I tell him?
Don't panic, I'll join you in a minute.  What's you think of Richard and Poppy?
Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night  if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
To see pap.
...Look, they love you, kid  everybody does. You see Caven's review in the Herald?
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
Go ahead, son.
Not big in the sense of large  although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
...That's fine.
Okay... a quick one, sure...
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work 
Can be. Not easy, but 
Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game  door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
What kind of scribbler are you  newspaperman did you say?
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now 
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life  why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
Frequently played, seldom remarked.
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if  well I know I sometimes run on.
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself.
Howdy, neighbor.
Yeah...
Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
That's all right, really 
Ready... wrestle!
Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.
Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
Seems like nothing but, lately.
A little lift, yeah...
...Did I say rude? People can be goddamn cruel. Especially some of their housewives. Okay, so I've got a weight problem. That's my cross to bear. I dunno...
Defense against what? Insurance? Something they need? Something they should be thanking me for offering? A little peace of mind?...
How did you know about that?
You're leaving?
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
Are you sure 
No... Can I come in?
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
Charlie, I'm in trouble  something horrible's happened  I've gotta call the police...
I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to 
Jesus... You're leaving.
Charlie! I've got no one else here! You're the only person I know in Los Angeles...
It's okay... It's okay...
Dammit, don't argue with me. You asked me to believe you  well I do. Now don't argue with me.
To be honest, I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnik 
Yeah... rye whiskey?
And then... well...
I  Mr. Lipnik 
Yes sir, they 
I'm checking in. Barton Fink.
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
L.A.P.D.
What do you do, Fink?
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
Anyway.
...I thought you said you were a writer.
Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.
Only fry you once.
He teach you to do it?
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.
Home. Watching TV.
Thanks.
It's not gonna take long, Sam.
How about the coke?
No.
No?
Yes.
You don't look so okay.
What are you doing here?
What else is new?
I thought you quit.
Sometimes I really hate you.
You did it for me.
Yes.  I care about you.  I did it for you.
No.  I mean it, thank you.
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
What are you doing here?
I know who you are.
How long were you having sex with him?
About a year and a half.
I don't smoke.
You like playing games, don't you?
I loved him.  I hurt.
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
That's right.
I passed.
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.
No, thanks.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
They were drug buys.  I was a vice cop.
What do you want?
What's your accomplishment.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.
Don't get too cocky.
Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
What do you want from me, Catherine?
Yes.
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
I'll meet you there.
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
It hurts.
I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
It's OK.  It's OK.
Make love to me.
No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
I don't know.
You like to hang out with murderers or what?  Did you know Roxy --
Of course I knew.
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
No.
Did you miss me?
I'm writing a book.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
Why?
Somebody always does.
I finished my book.
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
I had sex with him for about a year and a half.  I liked having sex with him.
It teaches you to lie.
I like that.  Suspension of Disbelief.
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
I'm a writer,  I use people for what I write.  You write what you know.  Let the world beware.
What was the weapon?
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about?
She misses me.
No, sir.  You won't.  There's smoke off yonder on the horizon.  They're gonna want your badge.
I got tired of being played with.
You think I --
You... fucked her!  Goddamn dumb sonofabitch... You fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!
Say what?
You feeling better?
You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you?
Why not?
You're my friend, Gus.
Where the hell you goin'?
Were you with him last night?
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
Are you kidding me?
I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
It was an accident.
Why do you think he's dead?
Can you check again?
Can there be some mistake?
He was shot.
Vichyssoise.  Supposed to be cold, right?
Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza.  You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb Be my girlfriend way
You'll never guess.
Didn't I say that?
Well, I could ... free up some time...
Oh.  Kyle.
Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
I heard on TV, Catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds.  How do these hacks sleep at night?
You're not coming to that, are you?  The Relighting of the Tree thing?
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Yeah?  Me too...
Vicki.  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
Photojournalist.
Well?  Was Vicki right?  About your difficulty with duality?
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
Oswald is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
I ... it was terrible, I leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
And exactly why am I gonna help you?
If there were such documents -- and that is not an admission -- I would have seen to it they were shredded.
You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
I could teach her my French flipper trick...
That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  Sounds fun.  But I ...
I got my own ... quest to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
I think you'd feel out of place at my party.  You see, it's for winners.
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
And who ... would you say this to?
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
Actually I have to split.  Take a personal day.  You don't mind? Max, you're tops.
It's a wonder you sleep at all.
...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
The _Rolls_?
_No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_!
Maybe they're right.
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne.  But all this. It's like the life of a stranger.
There's one other thing. I feel..
Recognition, of course.
Precisely. So this number is probably some kind of calling card.
Mystery.
Exactly. Mr. E. Mister Edward Nygma.
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
May I help you, Master Grayson?
...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work.
Why's that?
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
Exactly!
Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
Banzai.
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
Just ones this beautiful.
Still play with dolls, Doctor?
Me? No. Only things that need calming in my dreams are the Rockettes.
Wacko? That a technical term?
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
What? This isn't normal?
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
What the hell did you think you were doing?
How about Richard Grayson, college student?
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
And when you finally get Two-Face?
Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me.  All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
Chase is coming for dinner. Why don't you join us.
Edward...
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
You're right, Edward. I didn't mean to be impolite. Please.
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Bill Styles...
Old friend. Haven't talked to him in -- 911. Can I use your phone?
What are you talking about?
... Murderer...
Look! Police!
What about the girl?
I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
Please.
Thank you, Vicki.
It doesn't protect your head, though.
They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
Is this what you wanted?
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
Because I...  ... Because she'd never speak to me again.
I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while?
Odd desire for anyone.
There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
I don't sing very well.
Mm-hmm.  Lunch.  Not even dinner.
All street mimes should be executed.
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
Eddie, are you okay?
Alright.
Burned out.  I need a vacation.
Holy shit...
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
His face.  Allie, look at his face.
Yep.  He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop?  Jim Gordon
Oh, Bruce...
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
Great. How??
I just don't like it.
Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like -- nice guys?
Tell me about them.
You smoke, Ray?
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some.
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!
Fuck you're serious, Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.
I apologize --
Of course --
And he'd been shot.
Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
You wanna bet?
He -- He made me do it --
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
There were six of us...
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
He said he worked there --
What about the phosphorous grenade?
Yeah.
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
Yeah.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
I love you.
West... he's dead.
So did we. Why didn't you come?
Whose blood is that, Jay?
What do you mean, West's?
Okay, til tonight.
Okay.
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
Mueller.
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
Full clip to the body --
What don't you know?
A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
What happened to degrees?
Mr. Hardy?
My heart weeps.
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
Where are they!
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
I'll heal.
Time.
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!
Each day is a little life.
What?
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
Well it's in mine, too.  I'm a pureblood.  I wasn't turned.  I was born this way.  Just like you.  Am I evil because I want to survive?  What about a wolf?  What about any predator?
What do you think?
Nevertheless --
I'll show you.
Just out connecting a few dots.
Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
Human?
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
What about the confession?
He was here.  Watching us.
He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
You experimented on your own, son?
I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has --
Tell me something, Skid --
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
Stupidity.
You're wrong.
You're not going anywhere.
You don't have a few minutes, Frost.
I'm sorry, I --
Why?
It worked, didn't it?
He didn't. Get over it.
That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
What are you doing?!
What are you looking at?
Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
How can you tell?
Like what?
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
It's dark in here.
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.
You care about him, don't you?
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
Are you all right?
Get out of here --
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
How could you be a part of this?
Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
You're crazy --
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
How many of you are there?
What happens then?
But you use blood banks --
You're a monster.
Get away from him!
My name is Abraham Whistler.  This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --
The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live.  Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.
You knew Sergeant West?
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
That is the most unprofessional --
The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --
See, Ray, this is what we call good cop
Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
Something like that. You?
I lost a bet.
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
So noted.
Got it.
That was kid gloves?
Too neat. How long have you been an investigator?
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens.
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
Yeah.
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
...Drive me to a motel?
See a guy.
I just gotta see a guy.
...Well, I'd be okay in here--
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
...Huh?
Thanks.
...You ever get tired?
Hello?
Ray?... What time is it?
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
...Ray?
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
...You called me this morning.
...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.
I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...
...Anyway, we got some time now. But we gotta be smart.
I don't know what you're talking about.
...Who?
...Where is everything?
...You leaving?
What do you want to know?
You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing.
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
What did you take these for?
You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for?
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
Most of the night...
Now that don't make much sense.
...Anything else?
If the pay's right I'll do it.
It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
Yeah? Well how irritated are you?
What do you think?
I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.
Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.
...What?
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.
Red Label.
Pour that back.
Right.
This.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
Thanks Meurice.
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
Little bit.
...Why?
You shouldn't have taken the money...
You mean the falsely accused?
So did I.
You stuff sausage in it.
So what now?
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
Right back where we started.
No death certificates. No crime.
Seven.
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
Do I have a choice in this?
What are you doing out here?
Your phone number?
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
He was your friend.
The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --
What are you talking about?
A gay Senator's son who let his Sarge get fragged on a training exercise? The press'll crucify you and your father. His career will be over and it'll be your fault. But we do this different and you come out a hero.
Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
Poor fucker my ass...
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
What, The Truth? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.
He said what?
You're gonna die tonight, faggot. Clear as day.
Tommy, take a walk.
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
I've been waiting for you to get back.
You got something on the coke?
Pike never confessed.
No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.
Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting.  I followed her today to an attorney's office. Joseph Koehler.
She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick.
Thanks, Mister D.
That's what my report will read.
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
Increase his heart rate.
It would be an added stress to his heart.
Can you?
Why would she want that?
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
I was just about to make my point, Your Honor.
I'm just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else.
I've got work to do.
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
No.  I haven't done it in years.
A little after eleven.
I assume his girlfriend.
No -- but I can get it for you.
Yes.
What.
It didn't.
She said she was going to fuck me like I've never been fucked before.
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?
If necessary I can bring in the valet parking attendant and two customers who witnessed the occurrence.
You'll be sorry?
That's all Dr. Paley.
I'm sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked.
Childs.
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Why does she come to you?
Then -- those are not your own words?
What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?
What happened?
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
How do you know what kind of sex they had?
Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
What happened with Nunez?
He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
I was jealous.  Of course I was hurt. He switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with.  But I didn't kill him.
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why do you think he did that?
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?
Yes.
What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
Yes.
There are no charges against you. I'm here to decide if I'm going to represent you should that occur.  Did you kill him?
No pain, no gain?
And then?
Can we get out of here?
Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
I'm the photographer.
Yes -- she did.
Tell me about Doctor Paley?
Yes -- it would be nice.
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?
What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
Sugar or honey?
Rebecca -- take these off.
Tonight we open new doors.
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do.
Hello?
I've been thinking about that.  I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance.  You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy.
That wasn't the deal.
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
Don't push me, Frank.  I might lose my temper and send it out just for spite.
Because I'm expecting a call.
Really.
If you want me to.
He could let you have your vacation.
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
Yeah -- but can she cook?
I can think of worse ways to go--
I'm not.
You wouldn't like what you'd see. You don't know me anymore.  I don't know me anymore.
It's more involved than that.
You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.
-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
This is totally unnecessary --
He's not Army, it's not official --
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
No --
What happens to Dunbar now?
Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making too much noise.
Here, put this in his mouth.
You shouldn't have hit me.
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
So Caesar, what did it total out at?
All right!  Where's the key?
The same way you did before.
You don't think I'll do it, do you?
Where's what?
The money!
Where is it?
Yeah, I know.
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
No, Gino!
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.
All part of the business.
No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You know he's a good friend of mine. |Family, really.
Not bad.  What for?
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here.
Caesar, what happened?
It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
I'm sorry.  It was an accident.
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
There's no time.
What are you talking about?
What are you, drunk?
That doesn't make any sense.
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Caesar, what are you going to do?
What?
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
They're just cops.  Stall them as long as you can.
What are you doing?
Stupid cunt!
You need the money just like we do.
Where's Czech girl?
Saved me?  You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you.  All part of the business.
You betrayed me!
I had to.  You made me.
They were in a car accident.
Yes, I understand.
Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry.
Good idea.
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
You're helping Rajeev?
I should be going.
Another time.
When I reach ten, then I'll start with you.
Mickey, why is Johnnie here?  You know how I feel about that fucking psycho.
Okay, sure, Mick.
Oh yeah.  Violet!
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
Good guess.
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
Oh, really.
Do you know him?
Thanks.
I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
Curious, maybe.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
...  yes.
Basically.
Almost five years.
The redistribution of wealth?
I guess I wanted to.
Shit, here we go.
I don't understand - ?
I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
Because it's the truth.
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
We make our own choices and we pay our own prices.  I think we're more alike than you want to admit.
You mean Shelly?
No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman.
I suppose he just wants to watch.
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.
Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar.  He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.
Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
Caesar lives for these moments.  He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that.  He likes it.  The violence.  I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  He says they remind him who he his.  They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
Mickey?
He's the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be. |But Mickey doesn't like it like they do.  I suppose that's why he's good at it.
For what?
How much money?
Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it.
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
I'm just making a point.  You have no idea what you're asking.  How much trust two people need to do something like this.
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
Yeah.
What?
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
Like each other?  They hate each other.
Why?
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
Fine.
An accident.
Shit!  Oh shit!
What if he sees you?
He won't.
Not Caesar.
Why?
C!  Shit, I'm sorry!
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
You'll be clean and we'll be rich.
Jesus, that's beautiful.
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
Oh, thank God.
I'm sorry, Corky ...
I'm here, aren't I?
Oh, God.
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
You're asking me a direct question?
I thought you were never going to do that.
Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
I'm not asking.
No.  We can't risk it.
This doesn't go upstairs.
-- he went inside! --
Paris.  I live in Paris...
Treadstone.
Why?
Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
So it's time to go home.
Paris?
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
Yes, I'm here...
...I understand...
Who?  Who came?
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
I need a ride.
Get the fuck away from my car.
Get me out of here.  Please.
You have blood on your pants.
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
I don't want anything but a ride. All I want to do is go home.
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
That's what I'm saying.
No.
-- you could put it together --
You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
I dream I'm asleep.  I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up.  I don't think I smoke.
I thought about it.  I don't know.
No.  No.  Go around.  Keep going...
I guess.
Anytime.
Look, I don't know what's up there.
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
He came to kill us.
No.
I didn't know this would happen.
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
-- forget it --
-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
Nykwana Wombosi.
You could do that?
I won't let that happen.
We have to keep moving.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
I can't protect you anymore.
Where did this body go?
Where's the dog?
He run away often?
Get in the basement.
Get everyone down in the basement.
xxxxxx
-- but it was him --
What the fuck is he doing?
Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
What if there is no tomorrow?
Frank Pierce.
I better just go in and see her.
Is this what you gave Mary?
No!
They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.
So, Frank, am I going to live?
That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
You're not going to die.
Shut up. You're going to die and he's not. Got it.
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
We'd better go outside. Quickly.
Is there any chance?
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
Yes.
I think this place stinks.
He's working a double shift.
Yes?
He's better, though, right?
It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
Not as good as Nino's.
You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
I think I'd remember that.
Sure.
Give me the address!!
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
Because you can barely walk.
I need to sit down a minute.
Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
There's no time.
My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
She loves me the way no woman ever has.
I need a drink, that's all.
What's wrong.
Backup?
Greatest job in the world.
C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
Let's get in a fight, then.
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
No we can't. He's got a pulse.
I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.
I'm not hungry.
Well why didn't you say so?
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
No way!
No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
I have five-hundred dollars.
Yes.
Is there a problem?
Okay.
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
Ch...
Uh... Yes.
Hello.
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
I want to document my trip to America.
Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
Yes it's okay. Thank you for the food.
Uh. Do you like England?
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
Don't speak Russian!
When?
Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
Tell me what he said.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm going to make him.
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money.
Leave her alone.
Yes.
Yes.
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Do you follow or should I speak slower?
Yes.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously.
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
I know you just want to punish me --
What? No you're not..
What?
I don't want to talk about him.
It's none of your business.
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
I don't hate you.
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
Is that good or bad?
He's what she should run a mile from.
She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.
You could always make it up to her.
Yeah?
Now, that was a look.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
That's what he said. Jimmy.
Ask him yourself.
You heard me --
Maybe.
You didn't mind too much.
Charming.
Fuck off, Dave.
You don't understand me.
What?
Someone recommend you?
In a way.
What's his name?
Doesn't the water get to your nails?
Scottish?
How'd you guess?
Turn that fucking thing off!
I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
You are throwing me out.
Who's she?
Tell her I'm very happy with it.
Not me.
You all right?
Yes, thank you.
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
He's getting up.
No, I didn't --
But I'm not cheap, you know that? Loud, but never cheap.
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
What's that about?
Why?
Well what have you got?
Doesn't know the meaning of the word.
Tried to. Sit down, will you?
How different?
Maybe.
Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
I think you do.
You say that like a gentleman.
Did he come here too?
Not really. Maybe a little.
Yeah.
Why?
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
Drink.
No, depends on nothing.
No...
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.
You mean that?
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
I said stop it.
I didn't mean to hit you.
I know that.
Whenever. Tonight.
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Probably.
Absolutely.
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
Are you pretending yet?
I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
Stop it, Jimmy.
Sorry.
Please, Jimmy.
No. Can't pretend that much.
Don't be cruel.
Don't.
Why, honey --
Come on.
You following me?
Kind of.
I'm sorry, you know that? I'm really sorry.
She own you, Jimmy?
What you doing, Jimmy?
Afraid so.
You said anything, Dil
What?
Sorry. What you doing?
I had to go to work!
Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy.
What pills?
What condition?
Only in times of extreme stress.
I'm trying to quit.
Are you all right, Dil?
You knew which man?
Your soldier.
You didn't.
I suppose I tried.
I don't know.
See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet.
Then say it.
Love you, Dil.
Yeah.
Say it again.
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
You said speak Czech!
You've got to go now, Dil --
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
Fergus.
Lucky you.
Carnations.
Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
Absolutely. Long as she can keep it. Isn't that right, James...
Whatever.
Did you give him it?
Someone's got to do it.
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
You're never out, Fergus.
You were made for this.
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
Yes?
Who's the old geezer?
You a handyman, Fergie?
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.
What the fuck is this?
So he knows your name?
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
Yes.
And do you know why?
Why?
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
So it was you all the time.
Fuck you, too --
And who is she?
Just a girl.
Good.
It's a knocking-shop. Tres discreet, huh? He visits his ladies on Tuesday and Thursday nights and Saturday mornings. His security's in the car beyond.
Who is he?
Hope not.
Kind of suicide, isn't it?
Fuck you.
Yeah.
How is it a farce?
I seen your fucking face.
Only joking.
Nope. Not handsome at all.
Well, I could say the same about you.
Hey --
What is it now?
What makes you think that?
They won't let him die.
You want to bet?
Why can't we?
What?
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
Go back to your banana tree, nigger. No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
And you play cricket?.
Best game in the world.
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
Why?
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
Oh, yeah.
That you guys shouldn't be here.
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
Want you to do something, Fergus.
I don't know her.
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
Yeah?
Nothing.
Tell me something, anything.
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
You stupid bastard --
Got to catch me first --
Hurling --
Hurling --
And you know what?
People. They could be looking.
Nice lady.
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
Give me the shooter, Jude --
Give me the fucking shooter!
Whore?
My name's Sophia.
Charles Lampert's widow -- yes?  Last time I sent out a tie only the spot came back.
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
Only we call them agents.
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.
Yes -- and tell me if you recognize anyone. Just a moment. Have a good look.
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
Agents.
Who?
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
We wait -- with our mouths shut.
That's the idea.
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
He was American?
In Mr. Dyle's room?
Peter Joshua.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Is your husband with you?
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
Do you know what you're going to do?
We'll find you a hotel.
Something modest but clean -- and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay?
What was all that?
Who said?
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
On the street where you live.
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
No, they won't -- I won't let them.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
He knows everything.
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
What?
We want that money -- now!
Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen.
Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
It won't happen again.
Hi honey.
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
What's wrong?
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
You are upset.
Are you sure?
Run!
Are you sure?
What happened?
Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
She just turned off her light.
Well?
She's still a virgin.
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
Of what?
Really?
Of course I'm scared.
Why? All my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they've been married for twenty years.
I was desperate. It was gross.
I don't know what I'm so scared of.
NO?!
FINE. Are you?
What?
No.
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
Jody, we've been going out for over a year. I love you but I'm all out of patience.
I heard you got attacked.
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
I don't know. I kind of am.
That's not why we broke up.
He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
Go to the police station!
Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away.
Thanks for coming back for me.
You can ask me anything.
What?
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
How could you?
Who were they?
The principal?
I'm worried about someone.
You're the one who's hand is shaking.
Okay, okay.
Damn.
...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
Where do you want this stuff?
No argument there.
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash.
Since when does...
Since today.  New policy.
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
...and fair...
I need your truck.
...ya?
For cryin' out loud.
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible.
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
Come on, get in the truck.
Damn.
...all the time.
We're clear.
Suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone.
I ain't goin' through Missoula!
Yeah, borrowed!
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me!  Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula!
I ain't playin' that.
God-...
Okay.
You're nuts, goin' back there!
I was thankin' you, asshole!
...I'm not the psycho.
Back up!  Back...
Oh, shit.
Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
Come on, old Pete.
I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
Left, left, left!
...wanna give it a try!
All right, you got it, you got it!
I made it.
Go on.
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
These'll keep it cold.
...to him!  You don't know who...
...you're dealin' with!
I'm a dangerous man!
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
I'm crazy?
...here!
Oh, shit.
Keep still.
Oh, no!
Uh-oh.
Worth a try.
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
So I took his truck, yeah.
Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
You all right?
Huh?
Hey, just shut up.
Reach into my pocket.
Come on!
Okay.
Go, go, go!
Oh, fuck!
Okay.
...they come!
Okay...
What do you think I'm doin'?!
All right
Come on.  Come on.
...-ta get outta here!
Can we get out on your end of the tunnel?
Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
There's gotta be...
Hold this.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's go!
Why'd you stay behind?!
Well.
Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...
...us.
Oh!
Yeah.
We're worried...
Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...
This country trained me to kill...
...without compunction.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
Three seconds.  One...
...such is the price...of patriotism.
Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...
...help you?
Yeah, that's my truck.
So you called the damned thing Elvis
You-You can't let him...
You got a prob-...
...-lem too?
Sure as hell have met a few assholes like that, though.
...on ice!  We've got Elvis on ice!
I'd say we're about even.
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Put the camera down, Oleg.
Doc-...
...-bility.
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
Now listen to me.
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-...
Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
Almost quaint.
So far, ye-yes.
Pleasant surprise.
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
...Destry, Fair Oaks....
All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.
Dennis, radio the bikes.  I wanna know if so much as a squirrel...
All right.  Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.
Hit him.
Vaughn.
Check it out.
No.  A pair of average citizens have decided to risk their lives for their country.  I almost remember what that feels like.
Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.
Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn.  Take these two behind the van.
Right.  Tim Mason.
You know the suspect?
Long went missing from the Tech Center this morning along with a very dangerous...
Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
...gear?
They'll get a break tomorrow.
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
...dangerous.
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
...time to time, yeah.
Odd, then, that his car...
Like I say, Doc Long's...
...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.
I want you to look at one another...
I got someone who's anxious to talk to you, Mr. Mason.
I don't see my container.
...-tainer!
Where's Arlo?
No.
...checked.
You'd never understand!
I would've in another life.
After that re-...
Excellent.
Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less...
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
...is a perfect hunter.
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
...the master of his realm.
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
...forcing him to strike.  And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite...
...back...
...-to a simple thing like...
Shit!  Oh, shit.
And what if it does?
You're the only one I can trust.
Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
...seriously.
I didn't sell the boy any...
Yeah, asshole.  I'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who...
Don't move!
All right.
All right, go.
Get in
Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
How did she get that idea?
Who's the investigating officer?
Oh yes.
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
Are you sleeping with her? Come, come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
Maybe.
Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here.
What about her?
Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Either that or she'll be in jail.
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
I think I'll kill her.
Oh they don't?
Curly, where's your car?
How much do you owe me, Curly?
I'll throw that in too.
That's a filthy habit.
Sue the shit out of 'em.
I've been wanting to meet you.
That's just lovely.
How are you, Lou?
Thanks, Lou.
Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.
I get by.
Since when?
Congratulations.
Who?
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
Or her name?
I don't want it anymore.
You mean that's what you're going to call it.
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
Didn't you call?
I don't.
Let me show you something.
How did she...  ...happen to have them?
What pictures?
Absolutely.
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.
It's too late.
Where?
What's the maid's address?
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
You never learn, do you, Gittes?
Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
Do you know where she might be?
Certainly not!
A complete surprise?
A private investigator?
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
My husband's at the office.
You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
Looks like you went quite a distance.
Please call first.
Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
You left your keys in the ignition.
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
My husband.
And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
Mr. Gittes.
I mean I can't tell you.
You were seeing someone, too.
No. I'm just a snoop.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Another satisfied client's wife.
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
Never forgave him for what?
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
We got it. We got it, baby.
What? What is it?
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
They can't be.
Why?
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
You can't always tell what's going on there.
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
I know.
I saw him.
You saw my fa... father? When?
What did he say?  What did he say?
What about?
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
You mean she just found out?
Did you get some sleep?
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
...no...
That's good. Now what's her name?
Katherine.
Katherine?... Katherine who?
She's my sister and my daughter!
Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all...  but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know...
...so that's why you hate him...
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
How about a plane?
He didn't wear bifocals.
Let me handle that.
Sophie.
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
I cut myself shaving.
I said, the northwest valley.
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Yes...
Well, no.
Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he...
Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
The L.A. River?
It's bone dry, Morty.
Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either, I don't care how soused he was. That's like drowning in a teaspoon.
Well, tell you what, pal. If Ida wants to see me she can call me at my office.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
It's personal. Has he been out long?
He owned the water department?
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
They were partners.
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain finesse.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
Neither do I.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
Cut!
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.
It can't fly in this weather.
Suits, underwear, 100 million dollars...the usual stuff. Travers was smart enough to bring along a tracking device.  Step into my office.
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
WHEN SHE'S SAFE!
Glad you could drop in.
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
Wait 'til you get into trouble, just wait.
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
When we get this group down, I'm gone.
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
My pleasure.
Take the gun.
You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
You're not gonna die.  Grab me with your other hand!
Do you see them yet?
Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?
Just hangin' out.
Oh, my God!  I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar.
We spent a night there one night...
Enough.
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
I know...
I don't think you do.
I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
Why are you yelling?
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Maybe lead to a flare up...
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
You mean the nerve.
I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge.  If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--
Can't do it?  I don't believe this.  Don't you feel anything?
I only came back for you.
For the same reason you did, to help.
No, actually it was more like mutual attacking.
Gabe...your arm?
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
Nice view, huh?
Breathtaking.
No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
Up ahead.
Gabe are you alright?
No luck?
Next time, date only basketball players.
She's a lyin' bitch!!
They'll kill him!  He has no idea!
Forget it.  If that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us.  This way.
What?
Never, what?!
Helluva time for vanity!
Frank!  No, Frank!  Frank!
I don't know.  I don't know.
Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
What about you?
Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
The old mouth to mouth resuscitation routine.
What's he doing?
No, he's gone.
No, he's close, and he's using our money to keep you alive. Nobody's worth that much on the open market.  Except you, the loyal one.  Didn't I tell you to warm the place up?
Sue me.
Murdering, motherfucker...
When he finds the money, you're as dead as me.
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
Anyone else following?
Have her come up.
He asked you, how far?!  I think you've been taking the scenic route.  How far from here?
You and Frank get the tents, thermal clothing, and medical supplies together.
Negative.  The winds are too high.  I'm going to ride out the storm here.  I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out.
Oh, my God!
Climb, Gabe, climb!
What the hell are you doing--
Let's move your ass in there!!
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
Get off my back, Qualen!
I haven't even got on it yet.  Let's go, time to fetch.
Don't give him anything.
We agree on something.  And for insurance, take his coat.
Man against nature, right Travers.
You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!
Primed to go off right over his head, officer.
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
Be quiet.  Watch.
Hi ya' doin'?  Where to?
You got a deal.
No.  You were right, I was wrong...  ...Max.
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
Just had one.
Max, the cab driver!
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong.
You're kidding me.
Right through those doors.  The man himself.
You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
No.
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
Unbelievable...  ...you hearing this?  Unbelievable.
Most vividly.  St. Louis Blues
You know Dmitri?
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
Of course.
I'm sorry.
I think...
You tell me.  I had to toss the list in the river.  I was protecting your sorry, long-winded ass.  So why don't you show a little courtesy?
By the way.  Daniel said he was sorry.
Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke.
Mom, Vincent.  Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke.
I came to see you, you look fine.  We gotta go.
My hands are taped to the fucking  steering wheel!
Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
You hassling my driver again?
Yeah?  So?
... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I think you did great.
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?
Two minutes to get on Broadway. They're doing some roadwork around the bridge.  Eleven to get downtown.  Four to the Lower East Side.  Six to clear the roadwork.  One minute margin for error.  My math says twenty-four.
Mind if I time you?  What do I get if you're wrong?  A free ride?
First time in New York?
It's not that kind of job.
You should start a union.
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
Regulations?  These guys don't even give you sick leave.  How much you pull down on a good night?
Yeah, yeah.  Shit, man.  Guy fell on my motherfucking cab.
No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.
Did I stutter?  The trunk.  Unless you want him riding up front with you...but given hygiene and his sphincters have let go...
It's just a dead guy.  On three, ready?  Uno.  Dos.  Three.
Got it?
What?
...and you promise you'll never tell anybody about this, right?  Get in the fucking car.
Max.  May we leave the scene of the crime now, please.
It's not me.
I'm making you nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
Okay, try it now.
What?
South Central.
Music.
Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  Shit happens.  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
I can't believe this.
I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.
I'll deal with it.  I will, I will...
Because I have a gun and I say so.
It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
So what?
No you don't.
Lenny?  You're an asshole.
Next time you pull any shit, I'm gonna kick your fat ass.
Let go...
Collateral damage.
Am I collateral?
Jazz.  Music.
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're taught. It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
That's the point.  You play between the notes, you dance around the structure, you improvise.  Some people know where they're going to be ten years from now.  Same job, same neighbors, same shit over and over.  That's not living.  That's dying a little every day.  Not me, pal.  It's not knowing what's around the corner that makes like worth living.  That's jazz.  That guy up there, he knows what I'm talking about.  Hell, it's the same thing he's talking about, if you just open your ears.  You can hear it in the conversation he's having with that trumpet...
I'm done.  Find another cab.
Leave me alone.
I don't wanna know you!
I'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater.
Show up for what?
Jazz.
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
I'm sorry.
It's not bullshit.
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
The man who hired me for this contract.
You're gonna be me.  You're gonna go in, and you're gonna get the info on the remaining two hits.
Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
I...I wasn't thinking.  I just did it.
That's jazz, my friend.  You said it yourself.  So don't tell me you don't know how to play between the notes.
No.
You tell me to start a union, I'm blowing your head off.  Quit stalling and get out of the cab.
Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
Washington and Holt.  Dance club called Fever. Know it?
Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite?
I don't know.
Yeah, that.
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
Head towards Union Station.
There you go...!
I'm full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
Slow down.
Slow the hell down!
Vincent?
Well.  That was brilliant.
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
I should tear your head off.
That's love.
Look, I'm sorry --
Mississippi?
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
What are they doing now?
I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him.
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
You think I'm crazy.
Yes!  Don't let's get into this thing where I have to repeat myself!
What?
What's the charge?
Switch 'em.  Or I'll be dead by morning.  Don't want to be dead.
Love.
Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
It's okay.  The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  He had it coming.
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Yeah.  I think so.
Maybe we should do something?
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
This way.
I call, right?  I say I got the dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days.  You and I become a driving force on the local Geisha scene.
Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from New York.  You're gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since Godzilla.
Liza?
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
You do?
Blue moon...
Without a song in my heart.
Liza?
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
Do I know you?
Could you be a little more specific?
Liza Sutton is dead.
I'm not sure what you mean.
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
I'm leaning toward no.
You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
Number five with a bullet.
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
The lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad.  I was new, didn't know shit.  When the feathers flew, I got called in front of the special prosecutor.  It's on the top of my personnel file.  They think I'm dirty or I cut a deal. Doesn't leave you with a lot of friends either way.
While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
Which way did he go?
Hey, when in Rome --
You think we have time to fool around like this?  Come on.
I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
Yes, sir.
I said let's go, Charlie.
It's a hoax.  I knew it!
-- It's extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at.
I'm willing to take that risk.
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
Oh?  How's he doing?
Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
Ellie...
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
It's not like you've given me much choice.
David --
It's hardly yesterday; the signal's been traveling for over twenty-six years.  As for why...  I'm hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out -- to see if there's another message buried deeper in the signal.
Let's grab some food.
Throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation.
... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...
With me.
Interesting analogy.  And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?
You mean --
Ellie.
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
You...
... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air...
You said that in the last two places.
This... seemed best.
Good luck, David.
What would you have me say, David?
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
A third layer.
Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
What?
How can that be?
J39 Z186...?
Maybe we should bail?
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
I don't think he'd feel it.
Could we hear to the moon?
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
That's my scientist.
So who -- what -- are you?
Can you show me?
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years.
You have your mother's hands...  There are no tests, Ellie.  We don't sit in judgment.  Think of us more as... librarians.  Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation...
... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to.
No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
Now... you go home.
No!  I mean... why so soon?
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
Ellie... this is the way it's been done for billions of years...
It's time to go home now.
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
-- even if he doesn't receive the entire transmission.  Heaven is the mustard seed.
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
Nick, how we gonna bag this guy without any help?  Maybe I should work on that girl Joyce, she speaks the language.
It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
... I keep telling myself okay, that's just the price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you're allowed to get to the good stuff... but if I have to catalog one more quasar...  God, I've missed you.
I've examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing.  Still, we've barely started...
... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
The V.L.A.?
Greenbank?
But what about your research -- ?
But the work --
Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
I'm serious about this, Peter --
Like it.  Almost there.
I'm -- I'm fine.
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
'My father's house has many mansions.'
And you believe this law with all your heart and soul.
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
Now you know.
Can you try?
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
Some of my best friends are scientists.
Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
Maybe you're creating a monster.
In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
It's what my whole life's been... aimed at; the only thing that's given it a sense of purpose.
I read your book.
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
It's late.  We should go back.
... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one.  How did you do it?  How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves?
What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy.  A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social.  The weak.  The sick.  The unwanted.  And ever since we've been doing great.'
I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
I'm sorry.
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
It was quite a page turner.
Pretty ironic, huh?  I had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy... Just to find you.
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
They don't believe me.
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
Are you expecting anyone?
Surprise!  Surprise!
That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
It's good medicine.
Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah?  What happened to the newspaper?
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  Forget it.
Monsieur Andy can smell your coiffure.  And guess what else?
Andy?
I can see that.
I want to die.
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
About what?
Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
I know.  Do come and meet your guest.
It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you really want her help.  I mean if you really do, leave them.  Let her see them.  I'll see they're safe...
Tell her about what?
Yes.  Without question.
Because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hear voices in both ears.  Daryll Lee told me that Joan of Arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear.
He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
You already made the delivery?
What Friday?
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
We'll keep talking.  Until they get here.  Then...
Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way.
You can't go out lecturing?  Tough shit.  Women are dying.  Where can I lay this stuff out?
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
He felt remorse.  He covered her.
The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same.  The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful.  It's like... a signature.  He's proud of his accomplishments.  There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand.  He wants us to recognize his hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding?
How did you know they were stockings?
I sent Andy out on murder missions. For God's sake -- it's the Boston Strangler, Alber deSalvo.  He used their own stockings to strangle them.  Tied in a bow-knot.
How do you know that?
One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone.
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in your computer?
Because I'm his damned pin-up girl! His, all of them!  They know me. They're in prisons with libraries, they collect clippings, I'm their worthy opponent.  You keep my name out of this.
Ruben.
That's not consistent... You said they never changed their style, they're robots...
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.
Why should I trust you?
What's that siren?
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
It's not chronological: Son of Sam was before Hillside.
Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten.  We could use some help on the phones...
You do that one, I don't want it...
A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch married men!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...
I'm working on it!  It's what I do.  Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.  Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
Out.  Where does he go?  Nowhere. What does he do?  Nothing.
I've got to go.  I've got to go.
Are we getting married?
Christ, Helen.  The first time, we're ahead of the son of a bitch! I can't leave you like this -- and there's no time.  Knock yourself out.
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
Oh, shut up, and don't be so damn self righteous.
Why can't I drive home?  I will. You.  Look at you.  You need a ride home.  And you don't even know it.
You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I am!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison.
He's brilliant.  This one is brilliant.
You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?
That would be much appreciated. Thanks.
Will you stay?  Please?  I'm afraid to sleep... I don't want...him...in my head...
Go and look for a note.
What else?
He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
Oh, I know.
Don't put yourself down like that. I never used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
Answer it.
You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone.  I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.
What about her arms?
You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of evidence?
Shut up.
Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
Good.
How about I put Nikko on it?
Yessir.
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. Let me help you!
I gotta have Ruben, and a...
How'd you get in on the deal?
You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
Nikko?
That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?
I just got here myself, Susan.
I just got here.  Talk to you later...
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --
I want to yank Kobo.
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
Big enough.
Ha. Ha.
Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work with me.
Start it.
Joyce?
Me too.
What's that for?
Don't be an ass.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
And I'm supposed to care?
He drinks.
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
Tell them I'm not.
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
I'm taking you back.
Why?
Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.
I planned on catching him, Captain.
This is special, darlin'.  Please?
I knew that.
Could be.
Well, hello there...chocolate,
You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
Listen:  Top Dollar.  He owns the street here.  He will erase my ass.
You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the hospital.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
Don't interfere.
You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
I dabble.  May I?
Mister Funboy lives there?
I have to go.
In a better place.  I hope.
Do you know what you destroyed?
A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.
It's yesterday!  Do you know what you destroyed?
T-Bird?
I can see her.
Your pain ends now.
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Twenty-four hours, detective.
Annette Harrison.
Have we met?
Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just came in here to get something of mine.
Thank you.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
Excuse me?
You didn't show it to anybody?
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
What do you mean?
Forever.
Now it's my job to look out for you. You're like a kid sister to me. Do I look like some kind of gossip queen?
Goodbye, officer.
On my mother's life.
Okay...
Junior.
No.
How do you know I've been with several women?
A friend wrote me.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
Why are you being so dramatic?
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
What? Another letter from your friend?
Give me the fucking letter.
Refreshing.
Thank you.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
Because you act like a pig.
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
You don't find me cute? Come on, look at these muscles.
You're naked.
That's repulsive.
What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before?
Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the on button to off. The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
Who?
How about tonight?
That's also none of your business.
Without question.
Wait, don't hang up.
What are you doing?
Reading.
Of Human Bondage.
Alone again.  What are you up to today?
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
I actually feel good about myself?
I do.
I do not.
Fine.
No?
Not at all. Have a seat.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you.
You really want to know?
Yes.
Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house.  Was it --
Would you like a tour?
What are you saying?
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
Ben Schwarz.
none taken -
Where did you say she's from?
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
What do you mean?
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera.
Where did you find those?
What was that?
Thanks.  Nice meeting you.
So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
That's great.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
Do you want to learn or not?
Did you hide the letters?
If I say no?
Cecile, you have to tell me.
Well... not exactly.
If that's what you call it.
Cecile, you had an orgasm.
What year are you in?
I want to go home.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
Just a kiss, right?
Is it me?
Where are you going?
Prude.
I know.
After a court convicts him.  He belongs to me.
I do.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
You do?
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Who told you?
Greg, is that you under the covers?
Get out of here.
Whoa!
Your career? What about your family? Can you imagine the humiliation your father's going to feel when he finds out his pride and joy is a fudge- packer.
Positive.
Is she with you?
I told you I don't know.
Grand Central. You better not be fucking with me cause it's your ass on the line.
Ronald?
Well stocked.
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
Sorry.
Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
Care to make a wager on that?
Could you be more desperate to read it?
And if I win?
I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
Fuck her yet?
Blow me.
Call me later.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
I hate it too.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Any day now.
I'm aware.
Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.
What's your problem?
And that's why you're losing your bet?
Morning!
Well I know how it went with Cecile. She won't shut up about it. How'd it go with Mrs. Jesus?
She shot you down.
No, tell me.
I want to fuck.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.
Annette?
Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.
Well done.
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
I accept. Now get out.
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
It's Cecile.
Do you know when she'll be back?
I said, do you want some water?
What are you talking about?
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
I've done some questionable things.
What, Sebastian?
You're androids.
What generation are you?
We have a lot in common.
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live.
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
No.
This afternoon.
You're our best and only friend.
Six, huh?
You are mistaken.
Please, they'll kill me...
I'm afraid so.
I speak English.
It's gotta be right for my customer.
Soon as I finish the job.
Day after tomorrow.
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
You start.
How do I stop one?
That's right.  I am your doctor.
No, it's the truth.
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
Those cockroaches?
Four years.
Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
But if you could?
Taffey Lewis?
What night?
What's suck night?
I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
Me.
No way!  He's mine!
Who are you?
Us...I'm talking about us... We're the fish.
I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...
You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese...what did we use to call them?
You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
Right here...middle of nowhere...
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
Great woman your mother. Real foresight.
Where are my men?
Why should I be?
That's where my boat's moored.
Who asked you to!
What are you people talking about?
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?
You people...rich people...
Thank you, I work at it...
So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.
Quite a few.
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
Got it?
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
Yeah you did...
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
A meat locker.
We can't just leave them here.
You should talk...
You quit high school, lie about your age, join the navy, and next thing you know, four years are up and you need a way to make a living...
It's not them...it's it...
Not like him.
Yeah...
And what if I run into one of those things?
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
Can we use our indoor voice please...
...Jagger was here...I was here...
That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
I think he knows that Joey.
You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.
Why not?
In your opinion.
What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
If I don't, I ain't going back to get it...you think we're safe?
That way.
Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
A little to the left...
I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
How does an island sound to you?
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
Where is everybody?
Poolside?
Why don't you back off?
Is there anything else?
Why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here?
What's there to think about?? That THING back there...
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
So?
Do I make you nervous?
Yeah.
Right.
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
I told you I'd come back.
You did?
You didn't hear me.  You were sleeping.
Not too good.
Oh yeah?  Guess again.
Do you dream?
Yeah.  Sometimes.
When was the last time you cleaned this place?
It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
This feels stupid.
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
Because it's not.
No, I don't.
Just wait here.
What?
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
She didn't know?
Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
So, you divorced of what?
But meant her moving here.
You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?
-- ten blocks?  Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --
Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --
You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying?
I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive --
No.  Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault.  After the			* police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search			* for this man.  Until then...we do not alter the plan.
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?
Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.
Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
Only if New Jersey counts.
William Clay.  Call me Bill.
One weekend I went to a combat ranch...  You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint?  Must sound pretty silly to you...
I don't have one.
Oh.
Holly, we have to stop meeting like this.  So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery.  So why nuke the building, Hans?
Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.
How do you know?
Two?  Are you sure?
Hey, I love you.  So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there, man.  Hang in there.
Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch?
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.
Powell?  What's going on?
Ask the FBI.  They've got the terrorist playbook and they're running it, step by step.
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
He claims?  Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who --
How do you know?
-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
What's going on?
Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
I'm hungry, J.F.
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
Is that him?
Whatcha doin'?
Beautiful.
And you live in this building all by yourself?
Methuselah Syndrome.
Ah, you get hold of your friends?
Good.
Who the hell is that?
I LOVE YOU, DOMINO.
I forgot.
Fella takes out two kids and has the audacity to not show up for trial.
The children like to urinate in the balls.
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
Promise me... you won't tell her... that I never fucked Pat Benatar.
Okay.
We need hostages. Celebrity hostages. Just in case this gets ugly.  EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- LATER ON  The Cast Winnebago drives through the desert.
He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.
HE'S STILL ALIVE, EDNA!
Turn over your weapon, Edna!
After dad passed on, Mum's agenda was to hit the town and find another husband with a boatload of cash.  INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- EVENING  Sophie is dolled up for a night on the town... CLEAVAGE spilling out of her cocktail dress. Domino is feeding her pet GOLDFISH. THUNDERBIRDS plays on the television.
Cunt.
He used to date Pat Benatar!
You want to be a bounty hunter. Why does a pretty little thing like you want to be a bounty hunter?
No last names. Just Domino. The less you know about me the better, okay?
Mum was terrified for me. She didn't approve of my lifestyle one bit.
Can you tell?
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
You have sixty seconds... here's the question...  Which one of you is Frances?
Where are the bond certificates for the First Ladies?
There are no bond certificates.
Turned out Edna. had one last trick up her sleeve.  INT. FENDER COMPOUND -- KITCHEN -- [FLASHBACK] TEN MINUTES AGO
We are so fucked.
Mouth's clean, too.
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
Aren't you tired?
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.
How's the left these days?
It's not what you think.
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears.
I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
Yeah.
Do you enjoy it?
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, Pierce Patchett.
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
In the morning.
Lad, may I have a word with you?
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
What do you want?
Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn?
Will you work for me?
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
What are you talking about?
Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask a couple of questions.
Stens?  Was it Stens?
Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
Yeah, that's Stens.
Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
A naked guy with a gun?  You expect anyone to believe that?
Lynn.
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Stensland and Buzz Meeks.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl?
Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
I spent years trying not to live down to mine.
She's fine.
Richard Stensland.
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
How 'bout I give you your balls back?
He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
Ear plugs.
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department.
Where are the police academy files?
Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?
This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.
No.
Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
So be it.
Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
Get on it.
Anonymous.  Probably nothing.
I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
What's this all about, lad?
Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
Not even with Exley?
That's right.
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
Damnit... What?
Listen, I think I made a mistake, too.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, Lieutenant.
Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?
I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing this time, but I sure as hell can't see one.
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
What's Fleur-de-Lis?
What's on the call sheet?
Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case?
What are you talking about?
I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
Bud White's been here?
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
Not good enough.
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
Really?  What did White say?
Why?
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside.
If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.
Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?
Where is he?
Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
What's Dudley's scheme?
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
Don't know.  I'm chasing picture books.  Fuck shots, but the posers don't look like junkies.  It's well done stuff.  I thought you might have heard something.
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
Yeah.
I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz.
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
Working whores with squad two.
I'm telling you, I--
Nothing. Two nights later I was robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.
Someone else?
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.
Really?
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
Yeah.
I clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away.
It's a SAT-tracker.
If I knew, they'd be after me. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
Wait. What do I do?
They're spooks.
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
I don't know anything.
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my life?!
And you won't. Now move--
You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
Jesus!
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?
You told me no calls.
You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
I didn't use my name.
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
The NSA killed him.
Well, actually, you have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
Here?
They shouldn't have come without calling first.
I didn't see a warrant. Did you see a warrant?
Think we let out enough air?
We lost 'em.
Fuckin-A.
Same thing?
So what do we do now?
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
What if we transmitted it over cellular?
What if--
Pretty fast.
Baudmore Consultants.
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...
Hello. Hello, Maria.
Do you see anything you like?
That's fine.
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
Okay.
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
For that matter, I think you will too.
Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel?
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
I was in the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
Because I don't know.
No, sir.
Yes, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
Uh-oh.
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
No.
Well, you know--
It's not true.
Stacy--
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
Yeah.
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
How's the trout?
It tastes like fish.
Not that much.
Brill.
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
Soon. Or at least sooner than never.
It's how he works.
Brill?
I like our history. And I like you. I'd probably like Brill if I ever got to--
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
How can I be sure.
Good. You're just what I need right now.
Who's doing this?
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
That's temporary.
Rachel--
I'm gonna fix it.
What makes you think it's you?
Yeah.
He didn't.
I don't know you, I don't know your name, I don't know what the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' sick of this! Get it?!
Oh, well, that's true.
Excuse me, have any of you seen an eight year old boy, good looking, about yea-big.
Some of 'em.
Really?
In your dreams.
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
No.
Usually they take clothes.
They didn't take the silverware?
They only took electrical appliances.
Can I talk to you a second?
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
I'm a labor lawyer. There are always mob ties.
Ssh!
You gotta--
No, I--
Jerry?
It's been a few years.
Tell me about it.
He got hit by a bus.
I don't know.
Why not?
Get it.
Am I to understand--
He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
Contact COINTEL. Profile. Assess the threat. Then cross-check against Zavitz. Red-flag the intersects and anything we can exploit. Also NRO. Pull up the keyhole tapes. I need to own him. I need to own him now.
He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.
Help from whom?  Christ.
Sir--
Lyle?!
You're kidding me.
Dean's with Lyle.
What about--
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.
Through a window.
So he popped the pane?
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.
And the draft blew over the flowers.
Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.
You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
Exactly.
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
Where are you at least?
He's on to something bigger.
No you can't.
I can't?
It's sold.
How about if you try disappearing.
You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
Then don't.
Seems I am.
I'll call an ambulance.
I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.
You're joking.  You can't trust anyone these days.
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
Do you mind?
Well, no...but...
For God's sake.
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
I know.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
Possibly.
Not a word.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
That's my girl.
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
Motorcycle.
Got it.
What about your bags?
You really don't believe I'd take on a partner after all these years without a little...insurance?
Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could.
You're late.
I know it well.
Only a week?
So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.
I go in alone.
You don't get the Mask code unless I go.
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
That's because I wanted them to!
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
Someone was expecting that.
You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
I'll need that.
On what? Another job?
Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.
Why don't we take oxygen?
We are...for the tools.
Hmmm.
It was a long time ago.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
Won't take any time.
Terrified. Still am.
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
And--
Bookshelf. Sensors--
Let's mingle a little, shall we?
You can't be too careful.
Careful...careful.
The Mask.
Now's when you tell me who you really are.
What?
No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask.
Get the hell in.
I like banks.  That's where the money is.
If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.
No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
You've got everything planned.
Everything.
I told you. It's the down payment. And thanks to you it's overdue.
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
Everyone has secrets, it's what makes us human.
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?
Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?
Oh my god, I thought--
I'd taken the Mask?
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
Sit down, I'll show you how we're going to do it.
It's no good without the argon gas.
Can't be too careful.
Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
Charged.
Call it a new tradition.
That was a lifetime ago.
FUCKING THING!!!
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
What about you?
--You're a cop.
Which is--
Don't go getting sentimental. You're no damn good at it.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.
This better be worth 1t.
It better be worth it for me.
It's too soon.
But the second mouse gets the cheese.
Remind me why.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
You damn well thought wrong.
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
You know where my loyalties lie.
You're giving them to me?
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.
Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
I think we've burned off enough fuel. We may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely.
What's the little black box do?
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
So what does this thing do?
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
No.
Lock fuel rods.
Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
75% power.
Hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
I'm here.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
Yeah, I got it.
Got a smoke?
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
The name's Plissken.
It's the President, for Christ's sake!
Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.
Where'd they go?
Where are they?
Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President's daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings.
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.
I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.
Aw, come on, Snake.
I got an idea, Snake.  This looks like the prototype, right?
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
Who?
Don't follow me.
The what?
Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
Who?
I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
What honey?
Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
In here!
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...
Burke.
What's Burke got to do with it?
We have to start looking for a shrink.
Oh Burke! Poor Burke!
I can't believe it.
Of course I didn't.
No, she was heavily sedated.
It's serious?
You're a nice man.
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
What!
That's good.
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
We still think the temporal lobe...
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
Where?
Did he tell you about my party?
I didn't get you?
To begin with it could make things worse.
But how?
You could do it yourself...
No, you don't understand. Your daughter-
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
Where's Regan's father?
No
I told Regan that was holy water, I sprinkled some on her and she reacted very violently. It's tap water.
She killed Burke Dennings. She pushed him out of the window.
Father?
Um........Stuff.
Your kidding?
Well, not while we're in Washington.
We'll see when we get home okay.
Yeah.
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
Here I'll show you.
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
Well I heard differently.
How do you know?
Oh, honey.
I don't want it.
Honey it's to help you.
Mother please! Oh please mother make it stop! It's burning, it's burning please mother!
Goodbye Father. I call you.
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box?
If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?
He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said Take this
Quod nomen mihi est?
Oh really, when?
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
Let the enemy have no power over her.
The Lord be with you.
Defender of the human race...
Shut up!!
Can you give her something?
She'll go into coma.
You're not my mother!!!
Don't listen.
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the churchyou think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
I don't know anyone who fits the description.
Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
Very much.
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
Be silent!
Twelve.
No.
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
Come into the study a minute.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
What is this? What color is it?
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
You mean if I get sick?
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
Yeah -- me.
Drive.
Hey, bro ...
What do you mean?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
You're all through with this now?
Like ...
Uh -- to kill the doctors?
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying I love you.
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
We need to talk.
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
No.
Yes sir.
Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
Whoever you are, don't call again.
You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
How is he?
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
And how much will your fun net you this time?
Not anymore.
It can't be.  It's impossible.
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
What are you going to do, Castor?
You've given me the freedom I haven't had in years, and the power to make it pay off in ways I never thought possible.  But hell -- this is America.  One day a pauper, the next day, a prince. And I owe it all to you. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important government job to abuse, -- and a beautiful wife to fuck.  Excuse me -- I mean make love to.
Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
I've never been more certain of anything. Get everyone in position. -- And get the word out -- shoot to kill.
Screw your boundaries, Janie.  You have something I want.
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
I mean like protection.
That's your name, isn't it?
Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we?
Get rid of them.
That oughta do it.
You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
-- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me.  The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
Jeffrey nothing.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
I wanted to see you.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
What's that?
No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
As much as ever.  Nothing.
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
Have fun at work.
No.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
Then you got undressed.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
Can't you see I'm trying to change?  I sent Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you.  I wanted to see the candle-light dance in your beautiful --
So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Oh, that Karl.
Nothing.
Okay, I have a confession to make.  But you aren't going to like it.
Do you like that?
Nothing. Are you alright?
Thank you. honey.
Yes.
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
You can hit me, if you want to.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
No. I should go.
Come in.
Hello.
It used to make me laugh, but.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
What do you want to do?
No police!!!  No police!!
You like to open me, don't you?
Frank would open you.
Shut up.
Beeeee careful.
Do you love me?
Just get outta my bed.
No, it's not Don.
I'm glad you do.
Dorothy. No!
I did. Are you?
Oh no.
My secret lover.
They hurt his head.
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Oh he forced you, huh?
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
What?
I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
No. First thing you've said in the last four hours. That's a, that's a fountain of conversation, man. That's a geyser. I mean, whoa, daddy, stand back, man. Shit, I'm sittin' here driving, man, doin' all the driving, whole fuckin' way from Brainerd, drivin', tryin' to, you know, tryin' to chat, keep our spirits up, fight the boredom of the road, and you can't say one fucking thing just in the way of conversation.
Whoa, Daddy.
One of us pays the other for half.
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
Blood has been shed. We've incurred risks, Jerry. I'm coming into town tomorrow. Have the money ready.
Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
Yah, but this TruCoat -
Oh, now he's adorable.
Where'd you get him that parka?
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
Uh-huh... A what?
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Yah?
Mom.
They're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop. I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
...Yah, okay...
...How ya doin' there, Scotty?
We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but we gotta play ball. Ya know, that's the deal. Now if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in Florida with Pearl and Marty...
Mr. Lundegaard?
Huh? Yah?
No. No, ma'am.
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
Yah, real good. How you doin'?
Yah!
...Yah.
Yah.
Whatcha watchin' there?
Norstars.
...Who they playin'?
You told me about it.
A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?
Yah, well, it's a chunk, but -
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
What the heck were you thinkin'? Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank interest, I'd look for complete security. Heck, FDIC. I don't see nothin' like that here.
All's I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
It's my money, I'll deliver it - what do they care?
Look, Jerry, you're not sellin' me a damn car. It's my show here.  That's that.
Where is everybody?
Yah.
Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
Let's go take a look at that trooper.
No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
Can I use the car tonight?
Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven.  I hope I dint wake you.
Yah... Yah, yah. Geeze, Margie!
Geez! You look great!
Well, they're a good outfit.
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
You were such a super lady...  and then I... I been so lonely...
Nothing. I'm fine.
...Mike Yanagita!
So... they didn't...
Geez. Well - geez. That's a suprise.
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
Yah?
Uh-huh.
Yah, ya think?
Yah, okay. How's the hotel?
Oh, pretty good. They bitin'?
Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
No, no.
Was it reasonable?
Yah.
Three-cent stamp.
Your mallard?
Norm, that's terrific!
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
Uh-huh.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
Go ahead.  I'll expose you.
I'll take the parasites.
I want brain parasites.
I want that.
That's your favorite, too?  Tried to slip it by me, eh?
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
Really?
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
Here.
Sandy?... Sandy, please.
Can I come in?
Is that what you're calling it?
What... ?
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
You got about thirty seconds.
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me...
Who did this to you?
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
What do you want me to do?
Hi Dad.
Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
Do what you like.
A hotel?
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
A nice, big cock.
... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
Like hell.  That counted.
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, Now what?  He said, Get a job.  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, Now what?  He said, I don't know. Get married.
A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.
Hum.
Oh, a new riot control grenade...  ...the successful combination of concussive
I get cancer, and I kill Joe.
It's good to see you, Dad.
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
Alive or dead?
Good answer.
Listen... do me a favor... sit here a minute...
If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out.  And you'll never see me again.  Promise me.
That was three times you promised.
Good deal Dad.
You want to finish her off?
Look at your hand.
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
We don't need him...
Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.
I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Am I bothering you?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it about you and me?
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
What are you talking about?
People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.
You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
What a ridiculous thing to say.
...your sentences!  They're our sentences.  Get your mind around that.
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
Ask me nicely.
Proceed with remote detonation.
Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
What?
What?
Yes, it is.
Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
Would you rather be dead?
Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
How can you say that?  What kind of monster are you?
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
So let's do it.
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
A mortician.  He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.
He probably already knows we're coming.
Remember the onramp?  There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.
Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
Now, how are you going to do that?
What will I say when she comes to the door?
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Let's go.
What?
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
You're not listening to me!  You have to do something!
Tell me again how it started.
The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.
I tried calling last night but your father --
I know.  I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight.
They're next on the list.  We have to find them.
Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
This is cheery.
How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
Kalarjian?
Impossible.  She was on the onramp.
No, I'm good.
Yes. I do.
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
I guess so.
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
Hey, Dad.  What's up?
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Yeah, but everything's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming.  Almost like bein' able... to see the future.
Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.
Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction.
Then, let's go see him!
That... him?
What's the plan.
He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.
That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
Alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. But here... you're suggesting Tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active Presence.
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
Two.
We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.
They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
Carter, get out!
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!
That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
Why not?
Yeah, but.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
Are you sure?
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
He got a little jealous.
One hundred.
You break your leg, I'll have to shoot you.
You want a Dairy Queen?
Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
Powerful warrior.
You want to tell me about it?
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
Can you handle the door gun?
Brewer!  You know what that thing's packing?
How much we got left in that minigun?
I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.
Where did you find this clown?
Spooks?
Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him for eight years.
Where's his father?
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Okay, be careful.
I know.  I go with you.
How?
Okay, okay.
Goodnight.
We just take pictures?
Black.  No sugar.
I know...
This mission was a scam from the word go?
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
Jeffrey!!
Colonel.
Those men are all dead.
Yeah.  Big time.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say you did good
We left some people behind there, John... POWs.
You got it, sir.
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
Okay.
It's good to see you.
You want to dance?
Just a minute.
You want to dance?
Sandy, this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
Go ahead.
Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.
Stop it Mike.
Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
Any word back from the E.R.s?
What?
Let's do him right here.
What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
Anybody see ya?
Yeah, well...
Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.
What?  What, that guy?
What?
What about you?  Can you stand a toss?
Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.
How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
B.O.C.A.
What?
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
You're in show business.
All right, get up on that bar and dance.
Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.
He coulda been white.
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?
Whip it out.
Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
Give who a tail?
What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
Yeah.
I can't.
We put him to bed for the night.
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
Four.
Whyn't you get it dry cleaned and burned.
Well, I think you do.
Why haven't they killed the juice?
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
Then fuckin' find it.  I'm going for the girl.
Elvis has left the building.
Damn.
How was your tour?
The usual.
Butch called.
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
Nothing.  I just wanted to see you.
You give him his drops?
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
Okay...
I know.  He loves that thing.
I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
No, I don't.
Do you know where I found this?
415 Greenwich St.  
No.  This isn't what you think.
I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Frank, this is insane...
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
No kidding.  I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW.  Come get me.
Get him home safe.
I'll be up soon, Little Chief.
No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
I'm right here behind you...
Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!
Where are you transmitting from?
Queens, New York.
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
Fed up?  Lemme tell you something, in a 1000 years, when school kids study America, they're gonna learn about three things: the Constitution, Rock 'n' Roll, and Baseball.
Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
You sound...ground up...?
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
Hey Murphy?
Aye.
You're still my Little Chief, right?
What's that?
I lost you.
On the job?
Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
I'm glad.
Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  Cause I still remember.
What it was like when you died in the fire...
No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
What kinda twisted animal.
That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
What do I tell them?
I'll be damned.
Whatta we do now?
Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
Got it.
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
You really wanna know?
Hang on a sec, John.
He killed her John.  He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it.
No.
I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
In my pocket.
What...
Call the FBI.  Use a pay phone.  Don't give 'em your name, Dad.  Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others.  That he's the Nightingale.
Dad, you there?
Oh, Jesus.
I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
John, you there?
I don't remember.  Why don't I remember?
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
Nothing you're willing to do.
Maybe you outta lay off a little...
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
Got a minute?
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
So how are things at the hospital?
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
Wife around?
I look familiar?
Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?
How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
...so that which is good may flourish
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
A bit.
Me, too.
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
But that's no what worries me the most...It's how far he'll go to try and prove it.
Megan, get away from him.  He's dangerous.
Megan, take your friends back to the camp.  I'll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors.
We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
That was way easier than I thought.
Nine bodies.
No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
There's no time for this bullshit...
They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
Please don't do anything crazy.
Kill em all. Admit it, even you've thought about it.
If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
Diana -- you heard from Jessica lately?
So what do you think?
I'm strangely comfortable with it.
Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
...and it's now ringing...ringing... and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria? Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker over at the station.
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Oh my God, Steven.
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
Wanna know how I did that?
I'll be back later.  You just be cool, okay.
Okay.
No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out for six months after that!  They raised enough money to build a day care center.
Now, you will receive us.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
It is your corrupt we claim.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
Male or female, bitch?!!
Excellent! Number two. Greenly.
Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!
And is there an American, shit is there a man seated among us that hasn't thought about it many times, let's just put them all on an island, give them guns and let them kill each other. This is our wet dream come true. You can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law, then bury it from here on out.
Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time.
You almost sound like you believe that.
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
Twist of lemon!
Good to see you're feeling better.
You have more in common than you know.
It needs work.
You had to be a right-hander.
Noone orders southpaws anymore.
You really need that much?
Who died?
The Mission Director.
That's not the point.
Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the J. Edgars do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
You're going to have to earn your supper.  I've got my final physical tomorrow.
At least up there your piss will be worth something.  You'll all be showering in it, right?
What is that one?
How long do you stay up there before you go?
It's okay, Eugene.
What car?Go to sleep.
I walked right in front of it.  I was Never more sober in my life.
It's all right.
Call German.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
You really had other offers?
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
How was your evening?
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
I'm sure you'll be very convincing.
Michael's.
Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
I have your samples ready.
Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW!
Why have you done this?
Thank you.
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
I was at home.
Have they found our friend?
They found an eyelash.
What the...?
You're angry--
You'll be next.
I don't think so.  The only trip I'll make in space is around the sun--  --on this satellite right here.
So you didn't do it after all.
What is this place?
You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
Come on.
What is it?
I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
We could go together one day.
Not so long--just once around the sun.
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
I get my own help.
They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
I bet.
Get it over with...
You okay?
You want to drive?
It looks fine.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
You been okay?
You go out much?
Wait... give me a minute.
Sure.
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
You were asleep.
$250,000 right off the top.
I couldn't have... much longer.
Why are you laughing?
Usually on the right side as you go in.
For exits off Main Street.
You know how I feel?
My mind's not on guessing games.
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
I've never been there... When we met it was in his office.
I don't want to go there.
You sent me to him.
Who's she?
We keep going.
A man helped me open it...
Fifteen minutes.
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
You've got it all figured.
Why, there's nothing on the news?
What?
You're full of ifs.
Maybe. At least I got to him.  Where do we go from here?
When are you going to learn?
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
Let's do it.
Not now.
No scars.
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
What are you serious?
We better stick here till tonight.
Listen to me. It's hard enough.
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
Okay.
Can we make it?
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
Oh, Jesus... how?
I don't know.
Hey. You don't know that shit for sure.
You okay?
How long before this car's hot?
Pull over.
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
I guess we are.
Might try that.
Just in case someone gets a shot off.
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
Right.
Drive.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
How?
When did you find out?
And you told Brumby?
What did he say?
This is some crazy shit, man!
I made a mistake.
What name?
Why?
That's not good enough.
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
Who paid you to see me off?
You sure you killed them?
You must be joking,  Keep him away from the telephone. I'm going out for a bit.
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
Really.
Tomorrow morning, then?
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
I call that regular.
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
I work for him.
Oh, do you?
Really?
Really?
Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
Look, look.  Get your suit cleaned.
Oh, what you doing now?
Why would it?
That's nice. What'd you tell him?
See you later.
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
What happened to you, then?
Worst day of my life, man.
Well, I'm sold.
My brother, Frank.
Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
You're lucky. They kill as well.
Pension him off.
So shut up.
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?
Are you tired?
They're friends of mine.
I don't want to get rough, do I?
How could I stay away?
Didn't you know this is my home town?
Funny, that.
Yeah,  Come off it, Eric. Who is it?
So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.
Yeah.
Hello? You there?
Yes.
It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.
I believe these young men are right.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
Thank you, Father, thank you.  Whatever. Goodbye, amen.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Don't do this my son.
God have mercy on my soul.
I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.
Just go!
I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
Are you alright?
Do you like them?
No, where is it?
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
To do business.
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
I saw him with you.
The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
No.
Tom is right.
Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.
He's the head of the family.
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
Deanna, will you get back into the house!
No, Dad.
Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.
That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
Hey Mike, what can I say?
Mio fratello.
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
Count on me; that's my specialty.
Me and you, great!  Gimme an hour to wash my face and do my research and we'll have these Washington suckers right where you want 'em.  Poor Frankie Five-Angels.  He always wanted to die in bed...with a broad.
Mike, I got something special up my sleeve for these boys.  You ever hear of &quot;Superman?&quot; And I don't mean the comic book.
No.
Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?
How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?
&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
But, you told me yourself...
It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
I've always taken care of you.
I'm going to see my parents.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
Kay... Kay...
If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.
I don't know.  I hope soon; but it's not over yet, and that's why you and the kids have to come back to me.
I can't let him down.
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
Mikey, I hoped...
But if you're wrong...
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
I took care of it.
The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
Alright.
And Kay...she's all right?
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
He's going to try Panama...
The room has a bug in it.
I'd like to go outside with him, in the open air.
Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.
Do you owe markers?
It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago.
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
On a plane back to Sicily.
Michael.
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
You're a considerate young man.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
Except the President of the United States.
You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station.
I know that; but who gave the go ahead.
So, that occurred to me.
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
I do not.
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of.
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
Trust me; do as I ask.
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged this all through your man Turnbull.
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator.  But never think it applies to my family.
On the phone?
Sitting right behind you.
Are we going to eat or what?
You want a war?
What about Michael Corleone?
What about?
Jesus ...
I think about that night a lot...
My version of take this job and shove it...
How ya doing?
I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...
Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
They gave you only four days?
They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ...
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...
But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --
I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ...
You have my word...
No...
I don't think so, Detective ...
Not my girl anymore
Cadillac.
No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective ...?
You know where the others are?
How's it going -- ?
No ... And they won't take my calls ...
Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ...
You, too, Ma...
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
What time of year?
Kip and I'd probably be working at the dealership...  Imagine us selling cars?
We'll take it...
Yeah... You want a ride...
Any more ...
Kip -- ?
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
This has nothing to do with any of that --
Sure --
You sure you're okay -- ?
Yeah, man. Where is your beer?
Cool. So you're living up North?
Okay --
Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
I can handle it --
Me.
Me...
You don't think so, huh?
What are you doing here?
Too early to tell. Nervous?
Nah.
What did I tell you? What? What did I tell you?
You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?
She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand. Give 'em sixty ...
Thought I'd go for a ride -
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
DO IT! NOW -- !
Buy you a drink?
I left town. I didn't leave you.
Kip's in trouble
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
I understand -
What the hell are you doing -- ?
If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
What's wrong with her -- ?
Yeah, well ... She lives with District Court Judge Seymour Croft ...
She's trouble --
That's what I want ...
You mentioned that in your letters
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
No way ...
No ... ?
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
Her parole officer strongly recommended it ...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
Wrong preposition...
No worries ...
How is he -- ?
I dunno. I know a place.
She does have one thing you don't.
What's that?
The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ...
A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them... Nietzsche said that.
I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me
And the moral of that story is -- ?
Split it up. Any word on Donny?
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now...
I'll see you soon --
She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...
So what's in there -- ?
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
You have any other answers besides not really?
Right. You want to test the voltage drop ... Use the voltmeter ... Remove the primary lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her ... See what you got ... You understand -- ?
It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.
Take it easy.  We can talk about it.
Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.
You son of a bitch. She's been here.
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
Hello!  Hello!  Have a good flight?
Paul will calm down. You'll see.
I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him.
Who's gonna do that?
You know. The stuff I left.
Keep 'em coming.
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
I can't eat,  just get me some coffee.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
Yeah.
My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
Come on, relax. He's drunk.  He's been locked up for six years.
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?
Did he say what they're asking him about?
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
He's with his friends.
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
It's me. Martin Blank.
You could've been a contender, huh?
It's nice to see you again.
Not much else.
I'm a professional killer.
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Watched television?
Yes.
Are you there?
Yes.
...Let me get my coat.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
Right.
Shoulda brought my gun.
It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
That's probably a good idea.
You went to school with these people.
Come on.
They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork.
Morality.
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
Out Loud?
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
I work alone.
Like a club. Work less, make more.
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
Hard to get good help these days.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.
Okay.
Hey, Ken. How have you been?
Well... I have to take this over to Debi.
Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?
In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn.
--Yes. And the Munich Olympics in '72. A local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened.
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
Yup.
One cannot love and kill.
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
If he does our job, he's our job.
Good. For a second there I thought we were in trouble.
Throw that away.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
They're not happy, sir.
I'm not happy.
He didn't.
In Detroit. This weekend.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
Enough?
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.
What's a revival tent?
Nature made him then broke the mold.
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
Of course you will.
I have always thought about her and missed her.
Paul?
Fair enough.
Mein Dealer.
I have to get my head back into my work.
So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
How are you? How's business?
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
Why not?
Devil book. The Unix Bible.
Shit!
I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested, I'm sorry.
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
Yeah? Display?
Mm-hmm.
Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
I'm fine.  Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
Give it up! Just give it up.
This is the end, my friend.  Thank you for calling!
Crash Override.
No.
Razor and Blade.
And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
Okay. Let's go shopping.
Here's your class.
No, you're not in my class.
That's a nice score for a girl.
Think you can do better?
Pool on the roof must have a leak.
What?
Yeah?
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
If I win, you become my slave.
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
Make it our first date.
Thank you.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
Why did he come to you?
I'll make it up to you!
How?
There they are!
What?
You look good in a dress.
Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari...
Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
Hello?
My name is the Plague.
Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!
Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
What is he doing in here?
Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
Virus?
So what are we supposed to do?
Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.
Pervert! What are you talking about?
So?
Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.
Minor glitch with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe.
Send a Flu-shot.
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
We need to talk.
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
I don't know Brady.
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
We've been better.
Not without Jamie.
I don't know!
What does that mean?
No. You son of a bitch!
Get up there Rachel!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
Go!
Mom, please
I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.
Why wasn't I notified?
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
I don't want to have anyone live through that night again.
Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal.
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
It's Halloween. I mean don't you want to get dresses up in a really scary costume and get some candy?
Double scoops?
In a second.
I thought you said you were ready.
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
Forget it kido. We're home by eight o'clock.
Rachel come on.
I can't.
Rachel!
What are you doing out here alone?
You don't believe that do you?
I don't want to look pushy.
Call me.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
You look sharp. You understand?
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
Something?
Dear God.
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.
Evil.
You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
These kids aren't likely to forget.
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
Don't touch him Jamie!
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
The only things missing were some Halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. What does that sound like to you?
Saving the treats for Bob?
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
That's probably all he can do.
Fancy.
Wait a minute here...
He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
It's important.
Ten minutes.
They may be right.
He isn't a man.
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.
Where?
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
I don't think so...
Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Lonnie Elam said never to go up there. Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house. He said real awful stuff happened there once.
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
Not any more.
Mom doesn't like me to have them.
'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...
Laurie, what's the Boogey Man?
Laurie...
There is no such thing.
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
What did he look like?
I promise.
Who is it?
Tommy, let me in!
It's the bogyman, isn't it?
Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
Was it the bogyman?
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?
Listen to me. I want you to walk down the street to the MacKensie's and knock on their door. You tell them to call the police and send them over here. Do you understand?
Thorazin.
He'll barely be able to sit up.
If you say so.
Ever done anything like this before?
Only minimum security.
He said something else. It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone.
Aren't you glad to see me?
...you don't have to think.
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
They're offering...
And now I have dociled you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
If you'll come down the street I will make you a cup of coffee.
Well.  Word gets around.
It wasn't my day.
Perhaps you did not have the support you required.
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  natural composting.  Do you think he'd come after you...?
We got a bunch of materials, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his books.
You said here's what they want you to do...  Why?
That would adversely impact my income.
Say it in English.
That's the spirit...
...aren't you afraid of me...?
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're...
How crazy is that....
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
Yeah, so where is he?
...what a world.
Hold up a minute...
That's why my wife adores me.
The puppy comes back.  If you lie on the ground.  The Puppy with return.  Why? Do you know why...?  TO KILL YOU.  IT THINKS YOU HAVE FALLEN AND ARE POWERLESS. IT COMES BACK TO TEAR YOUR THROAT. THAT'S WHY THE CHILD TURNED BACK.  As Lechter will return back.  You see?  To the sight of his oppressor wounded. He will return to savage our beloved Miss Starling.  Bring me a drink.
That operation has begun.  Are we God, that we would Meddle with it...?  No, on the other hand...
...sir...?
Follow Starling, stake out Starling. Increase the pressure on Starling.  He will come to her.
The children...?
...they're from Baltimore....
I've never heard that he...
It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he does.
He's glad to help.  ...it's just a question of his physical condition.  You Understand...
What would that be?
He... would consider it a favor if he could make a donation.  To a charitable institution of your choice.
Do you know the seller?
And how would you know that?
Tell him to give it to an orphanage.
No, I think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
I don't mind being the token woman, what I'm suggesting, send me out there with a token man... who are these Warriors, our cobbled together Strike Force?  I'm in the room with a fugitive felon...
...standard issue...
Am I on that case, sir...?
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
And?  Then?
You know America?
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.
In and out.  Yes.  And Mama... and Mama, is not your real Mama, is she Franklin?
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat.  You have to go away.
THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the arrest must be a joint...
What is that that smells so wonderful.
Thanks to you...
And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU THINK?  BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE HIM AND HER FOR THE PIGS!
...when I...
Yeah, but who would marry friendless me...  Howabout you, Romeo...?
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
No.  I want to buy a dog.
I met a man, and His Troubles Were Greater Than Mine...
Why?
I don't understand.
No.  Invite us?  No, he simply...
Hello....?
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar.
I want the money.
The shape of a Three.
The great and beautiful...
I know it well.
I din't solve it, I didn't 'solve it'.  I just sat a dance out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  Facts, close the case, cavalier.
Well, you know, you know, you know, the point is:  I can't tell you.  Cause you haven't been there.  You haven't done it. And that's all there is.
I don't think so.
I don't know.  Do you know...?
...no...
...no.
Yes.
For approval.
Yes.
What is your point?
I..
And all he left us:  the Country brought back his hat, and his badge... both with a bullethole in them.  An' that's what he left us.  That's what I said.
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
Large resources, Starling, which I prefer to devote elsewhere....
My encounter.
Someone offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head.
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
Is it hurting, dear?
He's the manager!
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
sighs.
Well, I guess I take after you then!
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
What does old Stew want?
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!
Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
That's coming along well!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
Hello!
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
To be known as He!
He . . .
Him . . .
What??
I think I'm going crazy.
No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
Let's go overseas . . .
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
Just a couple more . . .
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
But that's not true! I've got one.
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
Isn't it beautiful!
It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
I miss her. I miss my wife.
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
All finished.
Hint. It's not a geographical location.
It's inside a moving car.
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
Pitbull attacks.
You just made that up.
I did more then that.
Well?
Did I ever talk about the accident?
No.
Sorry.
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Since what?
Really? Do tell.
Gwen.
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
What's the occasion?
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy.
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.
Really, why's that?
For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
Where is she? Where is my wife?
What?
Morgue...?
Please Larry. Pretend you like me and humor me.
Thanks for your concern Larry. And fuck you too.
I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out...
But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...
It's not that kind of date.
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
Give it here, Bernard.
Let's watch some TV.
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
Oh, great.
Do you do washing machines, too?
Do you have a family?
'... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down! And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
Aw, okay.
A man?  Was it a dream?
Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.
Holly -- that's not so.
It's okay, baby, the police are coming.
Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
Rita, he's only twelve years old,
Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
Has anyone seen Rudolf?  I don't think he came in last night.
RUDOLF!
I don't know how it started!
Mom, there's somebody in the house!
Honey --
Honey, do you want some hot chocolate?
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
That's okay, Mom.
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
What if someone else buys it in the meantime?
Now, Neil.  Stop teasing your sister.
Did you hear that?
It's just a dumb game they play. You want to be at a bigger firm, get used to the politics.
How was lunch?
Huh?
There's no card or anything.
Yeah, I guess it would be good for us to get away for a while.  Maybe Rudolf got the same idea.  Dogs need a change of scene, too, from time to time.
Someone nice will find him if he gets lost.
What next?!  -- A strange bra under my pillow!
Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With nothing.
Did you lock the garage door?
Did the cleaning woman come?
Yeah -- she did a good job.  This glass looks brand-new.
The floor has a nice shine to it.  Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.
What -- what are you doing?
He wasn't there.
What?
Honey, I'm a zombie, I don't know whether I'm coming or going.
I am so sick to death of hearing your opinion of my state of mind, what you think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. You're the final straw on this back, baby!
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
This is my house.
Oh God.
Are we gonna buy this house?
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
What d'you want me to do, Neil? I've told you we'll get another dog.  What does EVERYONE want me to do?  You want to move back? Huh?  Would you like that?  Should we all just pack up again and MOVE BACK?!
Get on the other side of that.
Right over here.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
Get to work.
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
You get anything on Smith?
Stay down!  Stay down, goddamnit!
Bullshit!
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
I didn't know he would have a gun!  It just went off!
That woman's gonna call the cops.
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
Celebrate what?  Going to prison?
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
That money's fucked up your brain. Talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be fuckin' killed!
I'm not going to die for this!
Treadstone.
You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.
We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here!
Talley?
We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.
Okay.
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
Give up.
Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before.  That little fuck untied himself anyway.
That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.
You got something to say?
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?
So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
I need to work out some stuff.
I still see that boy's eyes.
I'm scared shitless.
Whatever.
He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
Get in the car.  Now.
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
Get everyone out here.  Then call the Sheriffs.  Tell them we have a possible hostage situation.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
Get a phone number for the Smiths.
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
Did he say anything to you?
Did you find Jane and Mandy?
What's wrong with the radio?
Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid named Rooney.  He's amped up and volatile.
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
That's why you get the big bucks, Captain.
Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
Are all of you named Jones?
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
What are you people going to do?
Sit down.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
'Why' would be enough for me.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
Had to be done.
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
Can you open them?
Thanks.
What do you mean by that?
I'm sorry, it's a private function.
There is nothing to it.
Ten thousand francs for each one.
Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.
And four children?
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
Paul, you know who this is?
Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.
Canadian Club?
Excuse me, Colonel.
I don't understand.
You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African!  They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people.
They're only taking the whites.
They fired a rocket at us.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
Will you protect us.
Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it.
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
What did you overhear?
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
Watch everything? How? They are gone.
Satellites.
The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us. What do you think would have happened? No different.
Well rewarded Those were his words.
The front gate would be best, General.
Where are my supplies?
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies.
I'll be over.
What do you mean, General?
You know what the Scottish call it?
No.
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
You cannot go back to the hotel. The crazy men are going there now. Better to come with me.
We are better here.
You are a marked man.
You will tell them the truth.
I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.
) You cannot kill them all.
Thank God.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George?
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
I killed them.
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
Promoted. House Manager.
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
This goes out live?
This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
That will take time.
Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
He will be here.
I need a great favor.
I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
Was there blood?
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
Also, this is your bill for the last week.
Thomas wants advice?
Do something.
Please, be quiet.
They do not have your connections.
You're a liar.
Look at me.
Murdered! By whom?
Where are Thomas and Fedens?
Please, Paul, 'til first light.
Dawn. Then they go.
Oh, my God!
What is it, Paul.
Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them.
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
I can't let you do that either.
No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
Give him time.
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
They are being evacuated.
I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.
What for Paul.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
We're running out of beer and other supplies.
I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
Is this really happening?
I'm sorry.
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
It was substantial.
I want to know.
I cannot leave these people. I will wait for the twins.
Let me go. Children get off.
I will follow on the next plane. Go.
I emptied it.
We have to have a plan.
What sort of plan?
Anais, it is so good to see you.
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
There is one thing I need right away.
What's wrong?
You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
How much beer?
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
What is this about no water?
Can I help you?
We'd've been splitsville years ago, with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but Steven doesn't believe in divorce.
Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.
Not yet.
-- the whole thing is falling apart!
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?
Not at all!
Jesus H. Christ!
Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --
This thing's going nowhere.
Put it this way: if it's your face on that tape, Mr. Moses, we're one gunshot away from solving all our problems --
I did: down here.
Pamela Landy?
I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
You said that was an accident.
What is it? What's in there?
I did.
-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!
Yes.
What's down there?
The...Fourth of July.
Oh. Jesus.
Okay -- I'll admit it: I'm totally, clinically insane. But I'm still the only one who actually got a check tonight. It's yours -- if you just get me the hell out of here now.
How long? How long do I have --
Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.
closed.
What? Deep down inside?
What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
-- that's the fact, bud --
No. There's nothing new.
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
Good point.
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
Everyone that was invited is related to one of the staff who was here when the place burned. There are five of us...
Or an on-line computer.
What about that other guy?
It'll have to do.
Price!!
He's gotta still be down here.
Don't think it's even an issue.
was that??
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
For chrissake give me a hand!
Run.
...Jesus H. Christ.
Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.
Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: Haunted Hill is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
Then who are they?
You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
All accidents until proven otherwise.
My guests were shredded. It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy. I'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me, and then I'm calling a cab.
-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
I should be better by now.
What are you talking about?
Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
Stalking the wild poltergeist.
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
-- what...are...you...going...to --
-- wit...nesses --
-- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby --
Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
But you're sure?
I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime --
-- my loss --
Must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow.
then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
That's crazy.
-- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
-- the window and door grates --
-- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn --
If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the Saturation Chamber.
Well, I can't, sweetheart.
-- I'll take the chance, come morning and cops, I'll be proved right --
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
-- where's left to go? --
I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
It works.
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!
He must've beaten us all here!
I can't comment until I get paid.
What's going on?
What?
-- make the left -- toward the bridge --
Believe me, we need to.
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.
Ghosts killed your father?
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
There is something very not normal going on here!
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
There must be another way!
I'm sorry.
The dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs -
Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
Well I bet you they're happy.
Well then who did?!
No it won't - no it won't!
Are we leaving mommy?
I wanted to kill him.
I did.
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
Help me!  Please!!!
Why?
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
I only dream about people who are dead.
It's dark!  I can't breathe!
Fight it back Aubrey.  Fight it back as hard as you can!
Don't be afraid!
Oh my God!  She's in there!
Daddy help!
Aubrey run! Aubrey stares in horror at Maura - just then the knife FADES AWAY as Maura rolls over, returned to normal -
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
You didn't think much about that before.
Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura.  It's over.  You know that.
Whatever you say.
To our family.
Are you playing tricks on me?
What the hell is that?
I don't know.  That's strange.
What is it?
Well something just happened to the power upstairs... Maura heads off and shakes her head, troubled by the event -
I don't know what I'm saying.
It just disappeared.  Literally.
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
Good.  I'll start bringing things in.
Oh my God where is she!
Who is Pamela Landy?
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
What?
What's happening!
Why is she trying to kill me?
We don't know.
What is this, a game?
In her later years she would often get very disoriented being alone here.  She would call me, and I would come by.
I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
Your daughter's been taken.
What!
The blood of a woman is birth, life. It is part of the ceremony. Seamus offers up the pin - Maura waits a beat, then takes it -
Go ahead.  I believe right now she may hear you.
Say it.
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
She's coming back.  Keep talking!
We'll never know for sure.
The amulet...
It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
The rain is letting up.
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
Well, you know where to reach me. The church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass.
We'll be there.
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
Runic?
Abbott?
I want to come in.
Who?
Good luck.
I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
Are you an expert in amnesia?
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
Some women like Dobermans --
See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from.
What do you think? Is he coming in?
Felt promising. It's a start.
Anything?
Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
I don't give a damn about his girl...
Nice kid.
You did your homework, Officer.
Don't worry about him...
We already did.
Who's that?
Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
Okay.
Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  You said that once, remember?
Worth pursuing?
I know.
What about your shoulder?
Where is he?
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
That's right.
He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks.
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
No way.
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap!  We are nothing like Mike Flynn.  We did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- bitch Dobbs paid for what he did.  And every bastard like him.  We say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they'll all walk.  Every last one.  And I am not going to let that happen.  No deals.  No compromises.  No discussions.
What are we thinking?
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
Fred Duggar?
What did he look like?
There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
What kind of stuff?
The other guy?
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
That's what I said.
Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
My arm!
Who?
She used some stupid code name.
I'm sorry?
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
Thought you might find that.
Yes down at the station.
But she was an attractive girl.
I was a mentor to her.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
Randy Stetz is in jail.
Congratulations.
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
What the hell do you know?
This an accident, Walter?
Is that bad?
Wait...Did you say off-season?
Storm season?
I want off this island.
I thought you were out of town!
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
No means yes.
Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
I know it, and it feels good.  Hi, Ty.
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
No, I'm the King of the World.
Hello? Hello?
Karla! You promised.
Okay, I won't.
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
Cancer in a box.
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
Then, we fight --
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
I'm holding your hand!
I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...
It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.
I love it here.
You don't seem fine.
The shower again?
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.
It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend.
It beets being on the mainland.
It's...him.
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
It's in my room!
I wasn't dreaming.
Come on. We're gonna be okay.
He's in it with Willis?
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
Oooh, the mainland --
They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
'Cause that's the only way I'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this.
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
Hey --
Julie, is everything cool? Karla said...
Ahh, that feels great.
How's Julie?
Yes!
Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?
I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?
Cathy - how does it feel to have a father?
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
Why not Take the doctor's advice? You're the hero of the battle of Corphon.
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
Thea?
Oh, now  now look here 
Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
You see? Thea believes it, too!
Thea, what's wrong?
It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
Because she loved him.  I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man.
For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --
Yeah.
Shut up.
Yee-hah!
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey ---
Chief....
I never heard of a 908.
What is it?
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
Positive I.D.?
That one -- from the wreck.  You brought it up, did you look inside it?
I know just where to go.
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
Please.  It's my job.
Where to?
What else is there to do?
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
Do I have to?
You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
Bartending?  I'm 17.
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out.
Michael.
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
Hey, come on....
It's okay.  What happened?
What else you got?
Anything.
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
Temporarily?  Uh...sure....
What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
You're damn right that's what it is.
You don't make enough.
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
First things first.
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
The Shark's mouth.
Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
The shark that did this.  It was a shark, wasn't it?
We don't know that, do we?
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
Sound?
Where the hell were you?
I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal?
I did, I did.
Home it is.
Door's locked.
Mrs. Silvera?
As far as the office.
You have to smoke so early in the morning?
It's good with coffee.
Eat Cheerios.
Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
It's an island.  Got to run.
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
Oh, hi -- How was dinner?
Oww!
Nothing, huh?
That's great too.  Gorgeous.
Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
I know you did....
No dances, just tell me.
What is it?  What's the matter?
Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought.
I'm showing summer rentals.  We got a helluva season going.
Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one.
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up.  Are they all shark victims?
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?
Affirmative.  Can you get your chopper airborne?
Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?
Where the hell is Air One?
Did he raise the Kids?
You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
Sure they did....
Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
I'm not crazy about blind dates.
Can't he come out for one day?
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.
What the hell is it?
What is it?
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.
Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.
Name it.
Great. I'll see you soon.
Yeah.
Wave to my son.
What the hell is he doing?
I... I don't remember.
I have to walk him till the drug wears off.
With those camera lights and...
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
And a missing man.
How many sharks have you killed?
Well, not much longer to go.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
Don't forget you have your brother.
I don't know... I don't remember.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
My imagination isn't that good.
Honey, I gotta go.
And what else is bothering you?
Yeah, you really don't like him.
We play hide and seek all the time.  They find a lot of things.
That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
No.
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
They just wanted to say hello.
... Friggin' fish.
That's a lot of ground to cover.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
Okay, stay.  We'll come back for you.
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
Are you coming...?
I'm okay.
It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
Don't think about it.  It's over.
Kathryn, you're crazy.  Really crazy.  A suicidal maniac.
Fine piece of engineering.
Why?  'Cause they're hungrier?
I can use a shot of what he's got.
After this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and I are going away.  Just the two of us.  No dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. Just you and me.
We'll go to Palm Springs, Death Valley, Arizona desert, anyplace where there's no water.
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
Finally.
No, we'll go through here.
No,  I'm not going through there.
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
... He ought to put him in here.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
It was removed from Charlie Overman's body.
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
I don't understand.
Michael, you're not going down there.
You don't have to prove anything.
Go where?
Make this quick!
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
I told you, something's upset them.
Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it.  Maybe you'll get it one of these years.  Pack up, boys.  Flipper's a flop.
Unhappy combination.  Most likely one's inside the other.
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
The only Great White in captivity, Calvin.  All those people standing in line...
I will.
Like hell!
You look like an orange worm.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
How's sleeping beauty?
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
Philip.
And here I thought I was charming you.
Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
Thanks.
Massachussettans aren't.
'Course they're also so rich.
... Massachussettans aren't.
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.
How come?
You were great out there!
The one that goes underwater?
Yes, it's great!
Isn't this fun!
Take it up!
I don't talk that way.
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?
Make sure you put this back.
That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
Polar bears.
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
You have a man near it?
What kind of trouble?
Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it.
All right, hit those lights too.
Sharks???
Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
Yeah, right.
Just find your own.  Like Dad says, there's plenty of fish in the sea.
Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
Can you protect me?
Come on, sweetheart....
Not today.  Come on, Thea....
I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night....
He told me you both did....
It was a piece of wood.  A shitty piece of wood.  It's not fair....
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
I've always wanted to ride one of those....
I'll be right there.
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
Because....
Then don't come any closer.
Where have you been...?
Thea was attacked by a shark....
It went away....
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....
Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....
I can't help it....
You're not interfering, Ellen....
You want to try your hand at something...?
All he did was kiss me....
Whatever happens next.....
I always thought when I grew up I'd know what to do about things like this...I don't even know if he's serious....
Michael!
You have something to say about everything....
What difference does it make?  It's here....
We're going down.  All of us....
We'll divert it...We'll do something....
That....
The fish.  Check it....
Yes!
Thank you....
No, no...It's too dangerous....
It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....
Where are you now?
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
I want you to get out of the water....
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
All you all right?
Good.  So will I....
Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
You're having a good time....
I am.
I enjoy his company....
Good.
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
I'm fine....
I have to get this finished.
You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....
I don't want to talk about that.
No.
It got him....
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
I'll wear my rubbers...I'll be careful ...I'll be....
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
Sure you can....
You're impossible....
They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
What's wrong?
Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....
A drink with an umbrella in it....
Couple of more passes and I'll buy my own airplane.. Hell, maybe my own airline....
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
Would you suffer through a dance with me?
What?
Won't you get in trouble...?
I have this overwhelming desire to kiss you, Ellen Brody.
You sure you don't need glasses?
My vision is perfect....
You the architect?
Just like that?
But I... I need those books.
Photos?
They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   They don't care what it is....
Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....
How many...?
You tagging them...?
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
If you'd leave me alone, I'd be able to get my work done....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
I've struck the mother-lode.  I'm counting... spade work....
Spade's a garden tool....
Holy shit!
What happened to Clarence and...?
When I got the grant.....
Okay...we got it together....
So did I....
And it's always worked?
So far..
What she's got.  Nine knots....
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
Bring her to starboard.
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?
I don't like it....
What about Carla's gig?
She's not going to like it....
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Funny, Jake...Funny.
Just trying to be helpful....
'Snuck up on me....'
You told me what?
You jump, you'll kill yourself....
Anybody ever tell you you're nuts....
No way....
Jake.
How much longer?  This is supposed to be your party.
More beautiful with each passing minute...
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...
I'm afraid it's the van again.
Is it your vehicle?
I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..
Get out. Both of you.
Oh, shit. Of course. The kid.  Travis. Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so get it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at?
Since when did you drink diet soda?
What does that mean?
Watch my lips .. Don't get into it ..
I already did. What's his problem?
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
Maybe?
You gotta stop smoking ..
I don't mean this system shit that keeps you sucking, I mean stop .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, you can ..
Someone bet me a dollar ..
What do you mean?
Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?
Because I dislike her too much ..
Pig Woman agreed to take a test.
I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen 5 weeks ago ..
Where is everyone?
We're going.
Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
Then give me that Zippo.
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
Why's she blind, Bro?
Car accident.
John, stop it. The case is on its ass, you're closed.  C'mon, let it go for once .. Have a drink. C'mon, relax, drink your beer ..
One hundred fucking per cent! .. And you know why? Coz I never told her good-bye. O.K.? Is that good enough for the committee?
That's a very stupid question, Ross.
I'm asking it.
Ouch.
Don't give me that! Not another word! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said yes. So as far as I was concerned, she's ly- ing. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because you told me ..
I dunno what I can do to help you?
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
Are you sure you didn't call?
You got a quiet phone somewhere?
This cop that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.
We're not here. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
I don't see that at all ..
Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this.
You're pushing this too hard. It's like you want me to say stop? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
It's her hand. Her scars. Her dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
She's not missing. Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? No. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
I have heard you. You just don't like hearing me. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, in this country, would put a task force together for a body part ..
Three or four.
And did they?
Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.
No .. But we have a theory ..
Don't you know nothing about this guy? He reads the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross Freddy in my life ..
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small?
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
Yes.
No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
Hi, Lenny.
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
It was probably the wind.
No.
You should. It's wonderful.
Oh.
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
There's no one looking at you .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me.
Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
Thoughts that lie too deep for tears.
Sorry?
Really? What did he say?
Fifty-seven .. I don't mind ..
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
You know? How do you know?
You're looking more worried now than when you decided to stop worrying?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
I know about alcohol, John.
You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
I don't want them to arrest you.
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
Come on, Michael, outta here, the guys trying to move in. I told you what we know, something else, you- 'll be the first to hear about it ..
What does that mean?
Don't mix very well with beer.
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
Is that Margie?
I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the element is a bad idea.
I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
I know, but...
I'm already walking. Where is it?
He has? .. What's he doing here?
Don't annoy me, Travis.
Those are your clothes, silly.
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
Are you okay?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
I get it. You can drop it now.
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, You wouldn't believe me, but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
Different? How?
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
Know what?
Quiet!
What is it?
It is truly, whats the word? Inspiring.
He says it's a bad idea!
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
Nothing.
I filmed this the morning they left.
He's this way.
Where are we going?
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe.  I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here.
I don't know. I don't have it with me.
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
You couldn't have made that jump.
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
How low?
Here!
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thats where he's headed.
Just hold on.
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
Eric!
Not if it can't dig.
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about us? I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
I don't think so.
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
It looks intact.
We should take it with us to signal any planes.
ALAN!
KEEP GOING!
We're really gonna be in a movie!?
I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
The last of my breed.
A well-accepted theory.
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
On the island.
We need to head for the coast.
She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
Sure you have. You wrote that book...
No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.
Stan.
Sorry.  We were saying?
Is there an antidote?
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
Oh --
-humidity; I know.  Highest lead density on the market.
Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
Is that kid still bothering you?
That was about a year ago.
Dad!
Cancel that, Dieter.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
You're kidding yourself.  An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would --
What?
We've got to transport it seven thousand miles.  Would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member?
The velociraptors.
Where's the power and radio setup?
Why?
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
You version of it.
Their what?
You're going too?
No way.
Then this is our chance.
Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
What do they want?!
Come on!
Head for the roof!
I have to find Kelly!
Something's wrong.
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
Because it exists.
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
But why?
How many rounds did you find for that weapon?
Don't let it out of your hands again.  Can the kid walk?
That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change.
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
We'll find out soon enough.
Can you set up?
It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --
They're pushing us over the cliff.
These formations.  They're dried --
You think this is all a joke?
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
Oh, no!
Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can --
No.
If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight.
Move where?  Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Where's ganz?
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?
My assistants, I presume.
Have you worked here long?
Just what you've published.
in magazines Nobody reads.
Success or nothing?
A man must eat --  And drink.
The Castle cemetery.
Then its authority is in doubt.
A true friend would do it.
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
No, sir.
-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
I'm sorry, but I just wondered --
Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.
Tonight?
There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.
I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.
People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
Or what if there really was an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.
Gabriela! -- you did get away.
This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
They're dead now.  We can get help.
No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
Eight -- and seven months.
No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
He wasn't a lonely man, though.
Probably not.
I'll bear that in mind.
You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
She's missing.  I went to her house and she hadn't returned there.
That the police may have allegiance to something other than truth.
I didn't realize you'd been here that long.
It's a farce.
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
That's mad.
Then why haven't I been --
It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.
Raban -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
Yes.  Isn't it there?
He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
It's a factory in the northern mountains.  One of our best customers.  Without a proper request I'm not obliged to do this, you understand -- but I'll make an exception on this one occasion.
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
She was with you after she left Frank.
And nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but I felt it stirring inside me, this -- this wild, pagan feeling --
Do you always have to repeat?
I said that.  Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or --  So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it.  And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is.  And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know?
No.
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
So do I.
What was better? I made better bait?
Grunemann? I've looked at him a --
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
Yes.
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
Gee.
Company outing or picnic or something like that.
What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
I can't say he was anybody!
You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
-- OK --
-- You want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things --
Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse.
No thanks.
You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around.
Can't you get him?
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
Well -- she's dead.
You said it was!
No, I said what did you think.
Oh, don't be a doo-doo.
Mm.
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
Arlyn Page.
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
Don't worry.
What's the matter?
But if it's someone else I do.
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
Why?
I don't get you.
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
Sure, anything you want.
Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.
Is that all you have to say?
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Drop it.
Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?
Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my fingerprints.  Can I go in? I need some stuff.
Where'd you spend last night?
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
How is it back there?
Well there's a couple --
Yeah.
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
What?
You were hired to look for Tom.
Just send me a money order.
Would you like to know what's in it? The report.
I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've been a lot of places - I've asked a lot of people. I've found no proof he's around. I've found no proof he was ever around.
No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --
It's in the report.
All right.
I've just got a few --
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
I think she's trying that.
Town Police.
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
Nobody's seen that.
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
You killed him.
Bullshit.
I'll think about it.
You're a beautiful woman.
And law enforcement, such dangerous work.  The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.
I need to see his habitat.
No.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you were on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
I'm trying!!!
If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
We are here on official business.
Jesus Christ!!
What the hell are you doing?!!
A spring trap!
I keep telling you, they can come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
They don't really attack underwater and--
No crocodile has ever--
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
Is this a trick?
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
Was he a good man?
Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better.
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
I can arrest you!!
Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.
Get the gun.
Hey!!
'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
No way.
Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.
Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
Right.
You do?
Thank you, Jack.
Where is he?
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
You take care.
I never had sex with you!
But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
None of us actually saw anything.  I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
What's going on?
You should take a flax pole.
He was an Indo-pacific.
You think I'm that nuts?
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
Eh.  Fuck it.
Yes.  You may.  But maybe... I don't know...
Could we have intercourse?
And Hank.  I know you weren't really trying to hit him.
How big do the bears get?
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in water.  On land maybe.  But...
I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene.  I never believed it.
Why are you here?  Really.
How would you know, what--
So I don't like tents, why--
I'm not making it up.
Who?
Hector Cyr.  He's a rich kook mythology professor.  He's done some work with our museum.  He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.
There have been Northern sightings. But not this North.
Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
I'd be able to see something.
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
Yeah.  Nobody saw anything?
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake and a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
I didn't say it like that.
You did, you--
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
But why Maine and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
Let's get away from the shore.
Night.
Well.  Goodnight.
We could not say it and...  Well, that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to...
What?
Thing we can lift it?
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
I'm not mushing it.
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
Really--
Calm down.
Calm down.
Alright, Jack!
We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.
Hector.
He's mooing.
Keep firing!
Hector!!
Take him.
I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
Well...
If I'm ever in New York...
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and...
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
No.
You think?
Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
Obviously I was wrong!
Now I'm gonna puke.
Even if we could tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
Hector.  Do not move.
There?  That's the morgue.
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
I'm fine, thank you.
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
You talk to the married couple?
We?
I got nothing against--
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
You're sort of a rude person.
It's just that--
The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
It looks like a branch.
Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
It's to make you understand him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
I asked you to be nice to him.
What?  I don't even know the guy.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
That was a bust.
Are you alright?
Hank?
He said he knew Karate!
She's worried about the cow now.
Did you get him?
I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
Kelly.
Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
That's not what you came to say.
Oh...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
Hey.
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
This is what we do?
I never do field work and even if I did, Maine, to look at a tooth of a dinosaur who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
I really... I should get back.
What girl?
He knew her...!
You're all right! Where is he?
I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up.  Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?
Shut UP!  The other officers will be here any minute! you're perfectly safe now!
Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?
But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company.
Yes sir. I can find it by myself.
Not yet! - just wait for me.  Maybe in about two seconds.
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
Thanks.
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
A job's come up and I thought about you. Not really a job, more of - an interesting errand. Walk me to my car, Starling.
Not yet.
You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
Who's the subject?
The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
And what is that, sir?
Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.
I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...
They weren't there. Get close-ups.
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.
What would it take?
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone.
If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home.
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
He's making himself a woman suit
Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade...
Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.
Maybe they'll catch up.
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
All that detail, just from memory...?
No, I came because we need -
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
No. Tell me why.
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
How would he test?
Nobody sent me. I came on my own.
I heard a strange sound...
I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...
I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...
Yes. I'll tell you.
Starling.
Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin.
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
Yeah...right...
Not exactly a big ocean country.
Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship?  Why isn't he out swimming around?
DeJesus!  A readout!
What?...
We're getting out of here just in time.
I thought they were your friends?
What dead one on the ship?
Can you fix it?
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
No way to start a partnership.
Where the hell've you been?
I got hung up!  Try this!
Just get in yours!
Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
Williams...get DeJesus' suit on the sick rack and do a diagnostics.  Any other suit problems she should know about?
Sixpack?
That was a loud one wasn't it?
After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
Has it helped?
Maybe they already have.
We made it!
The internal monitors read normal.
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
No...she killed herself.
Thank you, Martin.
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
You take your money, too seriously, Bo.
It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's hear it for our shop Steward!
Listen to it for Christsake.
Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.
Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?
Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc.
You let him get away!
And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
Probably the plumbing.  You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what?
How far away is she?
What are you going to do to him?
No fuckin' lie...
What is it?
Who were you talking to?
Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Answer them and quit kicking me!
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
I wanted to talk to you about that.
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.
He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.
Well what?
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.
There is nowhere else to keep it, and it's the last place they are going to look. Anyway the battle's over and the war is won.
What do you mean?
Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.
Everything all right out there, Tom?
Where the hell are we supposed to hide?
He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.
. . . What?
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.
I'll only be a minute.
The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside?
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
I think I would rather just turn them over.
You know it doesn't include the amp.
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
What have you come as?
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups?
It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?
How many wings have they got between them?
The money, the gear!
Yeah.  It's French.
Yeah?
You bet.
Nix.
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
How?
You ever been married?
That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
doorway) And who's that?
Take a look at this.
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
Don't.
I don't know.
Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face?
I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
Does that mean...?
You don't believe me.
He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery.
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
Harry.
That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
Forget the fee.  If I find Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money.  If I don't...  ...my gamble.  Either way... I get to spend some time... here.
I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
Okay.  I'll keep digging.
It was more than that, I think.
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
Nothing?
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
Yes.
Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
Don't look.
Harry-?
Out!  Out!
Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.
He got up and walked.
Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
It's one in the afternoon.
Any movie stars buried here?
Probably.
I don't think the dead much care.
Are you sure?
Who is she?
Yes.
Yes.
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
What's her problem?
You need an ambulance.
Where'd you learn that?
Was he taking a lot of risks?
Well... nobody.
Are they all in the business?
They'll never find out.
Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
Help me.
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick.  No illusions.  Just the truth.  Are you ready for that?
... no...
Nobody's better off this wav!
In my time, and nobody else's.
Fuck.
A couple of weeks.
What about Philip Swann?
Who's not?
Fuck you.
Yes.
Hey, this works pretty good.
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
I spaced out.
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
I found them in your file box.
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
Well, if Peter here would hop off his laurels long enough to marry you...
My secretary?
What did you hear?
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.
You ready?
Given all that's happened, I understand. The world is random, but then there's faith.  Where are you in death without it?
Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
I had to.  There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.
Father, I'm right here.
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson.
I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.
Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says Goodbye?
Peter...Peter Kelson.
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
A narcissist doesn't admit it.  It's the extreme of self-denial.
I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
I think you gave me the wrong one.
It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one.
You're sure?  There was nothing?
Peter, please...
The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
Yes, I know.
So what?
Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry.
I'm going to look around.
What's the...OH SHIT!
Peter, let go of the chair!
What?
You okay?
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
Comfort.
You have to say that.
Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
What can I do?
How much time do we have?
Good seeing you again.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
Yeah.
There weren't any voices.
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
Yeah, right.  I don't know why I bothered inviting you guys.  I knew you wouldn't show.
Yeah, yeah.  I've heard it before.  Just be sure you spell my name right.  Nine o'clock?
So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
What's the matter with you?
He's looking right at me.
Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
Not what the records show.  Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since.
Had to let her go.  I see you thinkin' there, superstar. Don't.
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
What's the bottom line?
Could he handle a direct contact?
What have we missed?
The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.
In thirty-five minutes.
Twenty minutes max.
Book code?
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place...
Where?
Read it.
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
Why not?
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
You said the guy down here is good.
What do you want to do?
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
To recover the mind set.
Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
It's your call, Will. What do we do?
We will feel sick for a very long time.
No.
When I'm done.
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
How do I know?!
There's no connection between the families.
It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM.  The full moon is tonight.
You wanna watch this or what?!
That's why the boltcutter.
He had to.
Don't talk to me!!
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
Have him peel the top label back.
Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...
Wait for the back-up! Will?
It's happening again, Jack...
For Christ's sake get him!
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
What's being photographed?
Dandridge is a condescending prick. Ride with me. It would be because I want you to.
It's a surprise.
Yes, are you okay...?!
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
I'll get it.  Stay right here. You look very good in the sun...
Reba...
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
Yes.
Who is it?
No!
Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
Was I in an accident?
What am I doing here?
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?
Yes...
Oh, God.
No.
Can you read it to me?
Hi, Linda. ..
Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.
Do you know something about that?
He's right-handed.
He's very strong physically.
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
No.
Hey, baby! Where are you?
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
To do what?
I have to see somebody.
Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...
Do you remember what you said?
You haven't smoked in two years.
Have you ever omitted telling me. things before?
I have to go back to Birmingham.
You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards...
Mama was probably asleep.
Will? Are you okay?
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
Maybe we should give it some time...
Thanks for the lift.
Go on to the house...
Are you George Sherman?
Yeah...
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
What is he? Afraid to leave you alone with me now?'  He read the Tattler piece, didn't he?
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
Huh?
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
I got it. Thank you.
And?
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
Yes.
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
Pray tell.
Then how did you catch me, Will?
Yes.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
No.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
Fight what?
Pretty well.
Glaser Safety Slugs?
Kevlar Second Chance.
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
You need five years training to handle a joint like...
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
Just loud enough to wake me up.
That's it.
My wife.
What's it like?
Seen you together, that's all.
He's not my friend, Burt. But if he calls, or if he turns up here, then you give me a call in my room, okay?
What?
This isn't my room?
No, let's go.
Why?
Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.
Just two. So far.							  *
Hi, Leonard.
A cop?
Who did this to you?
Quiet!
You know him?
She was beautiful. Perfect to me -				*
I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.
Deals?
I wasn't helping you for money.
Yeah. You?
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
His name was Jimmy.
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
My wife used to call me Lenny.
Yeah, I hated it.
Who?
What does he want?
Don't protect him.
I'm not.
* Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -			*
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
Thank you.
What are you here for?
How do you know about me?
Who's your boyfriend?
Jimmy Grantz. Know him?
Are you Teddy?
You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
Then why are you here?
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
How can you read that again?
You've read it a hundred times.
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back?
Things change.
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
We've got to get him out of here.
I'll ride with him. You follow.
Who's she?
Why's that?
Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake.
Why are you following me?
I won't be happy until you leave town.
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
I have money.
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
I don't know. See, I have this condition.
This is a drug deal?!
I dunno... your wife surviving the assault... her not believing about your condition... the doubt tearing her up inside.., the insulin -
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
But he's not the right guy!					  *
No, you won't.
I should kill you.							 *
You can't just take it!
Fuck you; I gave you a reason to live and		   * you were more than happy to help. You lie		   * to yourself! You don't want the truth,			 * the truth is a fucking coward. So you			  * make up your own truth.						 *
I was the kids' godfather.
Sal Maguda.
She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?
Recruit us to do what?
We're not certain...
Of course.  From my side, I don't WANT to know anything about what you're doing or how you do it...  So let me know if we're on...
I don't know.
Where's that?
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
Havana.
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
Where's she now?
Mojitas...?
You know how improbable this is...?
Like three thousand a ki?  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
'Cause we guarantee every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Do I need it?
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner.
Would you find me...?
Where would I go?
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
I'll be on board by noon.
Yeah.
He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
You got something to say, Jos, let's hear it.
The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So...
That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
Let's go.
What happened to the last transporter you had?
Port-Au-Prince.
To the limit.
Like...?
Havana, Cuba...?
What's your take?
Twenty on my man...
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
Guy's involved in a meet...
That's right.
How?
From whom...?
Out of...?
I'm my own man.  And anytime you want to see how much man I am?
On the phone.
How'd they get onto you?
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
Oh, good...
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
Burnett?  They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.
Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000.  Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup.  For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load.  Transactions are offshore.  Dollars or euros.  Secure internet transfers.  We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided...  No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil...  That's the deal.
Conveyance?
It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. Jos knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
Meaning...?
And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?
What the hell did you do?
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
...He had a bald skull and...
Yeah.
Listen!
You want to split your hernia again?
To what?
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.
Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it.
Yes...?
...are you with the Consulate?
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
What did he do?
And you?
How much did you have?
You gotta be fucking crazy!  You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
Yeah!
Jimmy?
What time is it?
Two thirty.
We go back.
Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
What?
Cut his fucking throat.
ZIAT... What do I got to lose huh! What do I got to lose. And I'd really enjoy it.
Max, sit down. You're in no shape to kill anybody.
Yeah? Where?
Max - where?
Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money you have, you have nothing!
Know what?
Learn what?
Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay!
Who?
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
They saved your ass, convict.
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
God told me, since I was his number- one fan, that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So, went to town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. Would you like to see it?
Sounds good.
How long...?
What are they...?
They're called Novril--they're for your pain.
Shouldn't I be in a hospital?
Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.
You're very kind...
I guess that means it's okay.
Misery?
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
Yeah, thanks.
Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
It boils down to respect. People just don't respect the institution of marriage any more. They have no sense of real commitment.
I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
She slipped away? She slipped away? She didn't just slip away. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You murdered my Misery.
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.
As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul.
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
Misery's Return?
You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
Great.
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
Here, in case you think of any ideas.
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
I'm telling you, I can't.
You can--you have the gotta--
The what?
What?
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
Have to wait.
I'm going to play my records all day
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
To Misery.
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
It's perfect.
The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
What?
You've been out of your room.
That's disgusting.
Three more chapters to go.
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.
What things?
Dome Pear-igg-non it is.
I'm almost done.
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Four or five days ago. Why?
I been waiting a long time for some money.
How much?
What? What is it?
You really think Sheldon's out there?
You don't think he's dead, do you?
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
There is a justice higher than that of man. I will be judged by Him.
There is a justice higher than that of man--I will be judged by Him.
Oh, I like that tone.
He's your client, huh?
Yes, he is.
Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
I hate that I made this call--tell me I'm being silly.
Hey, Pete.
Answer me a couple things?
Marcia, why are you doing this to me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? Don't you think I remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books? You think I'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness?  I'm doing this because I have to.  Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and I want your good thoughts--because if I can make it work ...  I might just have something that I want on my tombstone.
I'm delighted the critics are liking it, and I hope the people like it, too. But it's not why I wrote the book.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
How I usually find you, Nyah.
Magic...
Your room.
Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...
Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.
Then don't say it.
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
A change of plans?
Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind.
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again.
Oh.  then you knew the only way could smuggle the live virus to the CDC scientists in Atlanta was by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a Petri dish, doing it inside of twenty hours so he could take the anti-virus and still have it be effective.  You knew that while you were knocking him off and destroying the very thing you came for.
She wouldn't  be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt.  from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me.  Ball's in your court, Hunt.  What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer.
It's that time.  Go.
What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?
Right.
Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
Uh-huh.
torque wrench.
right..
Do what?
At least you walked.
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
Where did you get this number?  I don't even have it!
I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
Ethan Hunt.
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
But it is what you'd like me to do. so tell me to do it..
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
I don't.
Much.
Then feel better!..
Before you are.
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
Just like old times?
Just about..
Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
I'll muddle through.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
How do you suggest I go about it?
Are you okay?
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
Why did you phrase it like that?
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -
Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
Well it's not mission difficult, Hunt. It's mission impossible.  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.  If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.
Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
- good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
No.  I can't afford to be curious.  And neither can you, Hunt..
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
I do.
Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor..
You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.
Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
Why not?
Right.  I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.
Nekhorvich's boss?
Yep.
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
Let's start from the inside out.
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
Copy.  She's only got twenty-eight minutes left.  Track ahead and pick her up.
So what did he say?
Good idea.
Always.
You were in the car!
No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
What happened to Jim?
Take off your coat.
Take off your God damn coat!
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
I'm going to answer it.
Max made a deal with you?
I didn't say that.
What about you?
What about me - Jim called an abort - I didn't comply.  I lost the team. I just need you to be safe.
I sent the message to Max.  We?re on for tomorrow.
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
It?s all right, Ethan..you?ll bring me back...won?t you...
I always have, Claire..
They?re dead.
Let's just bring you in safely, and then we'll worry about that, okay?  Were you followed?
Don?t think, be sure.  Are you clean?
Location green.  One hour.  I?ll be there myself.
One hour.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
What are we downloading?
Information.
What kind?
Profitable.
Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- with the artificial intelligence Risk chip --
I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
What makes you trust me?
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
We split 50-50?
You gonna let me keep any of it?
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
On what?
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and see if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
I wouldn't dream of it.
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesn?t prelude a meeting in private.
It doesn?t, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
Do you want to blow the fire through the whole building?
He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.
OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.
Why?
Then what am I doing here?
I'm willing to take the chance.
I'd say you've got about two minutes.
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
He won't be back in a hurry?
We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
Can you lose him?
Abort.  That?s an order.
Where are you?
About two hundred yards from the bridge.
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - without your permission.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How dare he?  You realize it?s over, you?re an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, you?ve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, we?ll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
What he didn?t get in Prague.  The NOC list.
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
Jim...?
No.  she can?t know about Me.  No One can.  not til this is over.  There?s too much at stake; Ethan.
But, he didn?t know about you.  In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  Thou shall not covet thy Neighbour?s wife, Ethan.  Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it.  And like all the world?s lovers, he?s tortured by the same, one pathetic question - does she feel the same way I do?
Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?
Jim, it?s over.
Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.
Run it through from the top.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
What's going on, Cynthia?
They fired everyone.
No.
I'm going home Cynthia.
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
But I'm not broke.
The Cowboy??
You gotta be kidding?
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
Whatever.
How's that?
Okay.
It will work out.
Yes...what is it?
... What??
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
It's unbelievable!
You got it! See you later honey.
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.
Good luck, honey!
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
No, no, I'm fine.
What?
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.
How do you remember how to talk?
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
Maybe it's not me.
Before what?
Before I kill you.
Good luck!
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
Rita... I know what you're doing.
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
I know what you have to do, but let me do it.
Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
To my audition.
Yes, Sir.
Betty Elms.
Thank you... thank you very much.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.
Do you miss Mallory?
Was what worth it?
Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
Scott's dead. And unless you wanna play follow the leader, shut up and do as you're told.
Where's it parked?
'Respected journalist'-- On your knees...
We ain't got all fuckin' day!
...developed between the three of us. We're kindda in this together, don't ya think?
No. Not really.
Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.
We are.  Your camera.
And they made the first move?
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
Jesus...
I hear ya. Play.
You can't be serious?
Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?
Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.
Really?
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
What are we talking about?
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
Tough day?
Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
Can --
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
No way...
Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
And you have this letter of intent?
Yes. That's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
No, I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually wondering about... Well, my cut.
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
Gee... What makes you say that?
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
Isn't it always?
Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.
My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.
It's not true.
It's not the gas, Dad!
What are you talking about?
She walked.
You two got a thing going, or what?
So, you live around here.
What the hell are you talking about?
My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
Schneider's always got a stick up his ass.
I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.
That's okay, I wanted to.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Fred Krueger.  The guy in her dream who's coming to kill her.  Seems he was a real guy, ten years before who went around kidnapping kids and killing them.
Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.
What's all this.
I don't know.  Where are we going?
What is this place?
Here.
Any ghosts in here?
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Shhh.  Just concentrate.
Uh-uh.  Wait...
About not finding any bogey men?
Oh, Jesse...
I'm not hungry.
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
Jesse, God - what happened?
I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's inside me...
Fred Krueger.  He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me.  He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.
Who's that?
Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.
Hi, Kerry.
You're going out?
Thanks, Mom.
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
I know who's trying to kill you.
Last time, it was me against him.  I wasn't strong enough...alone.
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
Kincaid -- we should find the others first...
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
How do we find him, Kristen?
I don't know.
They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
A little basic, but nice.
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.
Max, where's Kristen?
You know what he did.  He's doing it again.
You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
Just until we get things under control.
I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.
I can't believe I just did that.
We're gonna try.
Doesn't matter.
C'mon.  Let's get out of this rain.
Remember -- open mind.
Take us there, Kristen.
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
Anything?
You're not going in.  That's exactly what he wants.  As long as you're on Hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you.
I've heard crazier things this week.
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
Masters of our own destiny.
So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
I could've saved them.
The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of scandal...
My God.
I'll go straight to Carver if I have to.  He'll either back me up or accept my resignation.
For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
It can buy you a new and better you.
They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the Don't Disturb sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
We pay better.
Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
You'll be there?
Eight A.M. flight.
What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up.
I guess it lacks a certain style.
No. Just confidence.
We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
Why?
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
I think two million.
No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake.  And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape.
No thanks. I'm good.
Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?
I had to! That motherfucker was about to welch! You saw what he was doing, right? You heard him!
Yeah, I see her.
Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.
Says who?
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Why?
What do I have to do?
Just play a part. A little acting.
What about Customs?
Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
Mr. King, I think --
What the hell's his problem?
Uh-huh.
But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
It's more than that.
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
Sounds respectable.
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.
After Glenn was finished, he gave me a couple of valiums and I went home. The next day, I finished my shift and met him around back, like we always did. I stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest. Three or four times.
Did, uh... Did you kill him?
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
What're you talking about?
Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
Yes, it is.
Who is it?
No, thanks.
Why not?
Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been.  He tell you how they met?
Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start.  Battery was dead.  He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.  They musta robbed fifty banks together.
Ask him his name.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Jesus... Take it easy.
You say you perform in the Miami area?
Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!
Go away, or I'll call the police.
Okay, honey, come on out of there.
Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.
His idea?  Gimme a break.  Fuckin' guy's got a vacant lot for a head.  Was you and me figured the whole thing out.
Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time, waiting to make her move.
Oh, man.
Maybe this'll make you feel better.
You'll have to ask Glenn.  And most likely, he's on his way to Detroit, where we should be.
What about what?
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
He knows where she lives?
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
I'm going to say this one last time for you, so take a deep breath and count to ten. There is no cut.
Whatta you think?
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
How long you talk to her?
Two hours.
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
You know how I felt about her.
You find out?
And who watches your back?
I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
You ever wear one of these?
At least.
I'm going back inside.
Hello, Daniel.
Daniel Burdon, FBI.
Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
Is that what you would've done?
Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
All right, but...
But don't you do anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
What do you want to bet?
If you move, if you look at her again, you're dead.
What do you want? An apology?
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred bucks for a pillow?
Like being back in the yard, huh?
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Who's sitting here?
Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is...
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
Nervous?
If I could have a little more room.
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
Where's your gun, your pistol?
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.
One I gave him, yeah.  Fuck...
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
Sure.
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
Is that right?
Yeah.
That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.
Really.
Yes.
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
How do we do that?
You won't do that.
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
What, as a sales rep?
I like your hair.  And that suit.
You did?
Well, does it make sense to you?
She did, huh.
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
He killed a police officer.
You believe that?
Why not?
What about my motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
You getting serious on me now?
You know.
Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
You think he's lying?
You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
The backseat.
These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
Any time.
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You told him you keep 'em at your house.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
The next time I walk into a bank.
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
You goin' right back to work?
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
Islamic.
What's it mean, No Hair?
And so now you're off to Glades.
Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
Foley's not going to make it.  And if he goes down, Glenn, you go with him.
What's going on, Glenn?
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
Gee, I wonder why not.
Really?
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
I wanna talk to you about a job.
Gimme another hint.
Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?
What?
Me?
I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is my job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
Hey, shit, come on.  I say I want this car, man, it's mine.  You go get yourself another one.  I say I'm in on Ripley?  I'm in, with or without your ass.  I say I want you to come along on another job, see if you for real or not, guess what you gonna do?
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
He took the week off so we'd have time together.  So far he's worked on his boat every day.  Dad?  Ray Nicolet.
You're not my type.
Just a minute.
Thanks.
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
It's a --
--Sig-Sauer .38.  I love it.
Technically.  They're separated.
Oh, he's moved out?
You used to like it.
We don't get to talk much any more.
I'd like that.
Hello?
He's pretty laid back, confident.
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
Not at all.
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
We're getting a little old for running.
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
So?
It's possible.  Why?
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
When's he due back?
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
Is it all fugasi?
I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward.
That's how you score now?
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
Jack Foley, famous bank robber.
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.
And we got rid of the red head.
Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.
This is embarrassing.
You going to have the time?
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
Point is, you don't go through with this, he's going to go after you next. And he don't even like you, Jake.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
Aces, Suits.
I can handle it.
It's not history.
What?
Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.
I'm not burying him here...
Yeah...
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
You think he'd believe it if he did?
It's weird...
I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...
I gotta go back and do my chores...
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
Not sure. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing....
Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
'Mean the whispers?
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
But I just wanted to say --
What do you see? Riddick?
Listen.
Get out of our way.
Let's drop back an' boot up.
Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was his monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
Step aboard, Carolyn.
I can't....I can't....
It's starting....
...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I think two more....
How many bottles?
Hey, who?
We just keep him locked up forever?
A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do not wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
What?
So I noticed. Never seen a captain quite so ready to leave her ship.
What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
What?
Thought he might be coolin' it in the boneyard -- could either double-back to the ship or slip in behind us. So I left the bottle out as bait.
Like my pistola.
...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
25 kilos each, huh?
Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --
60 years ago.
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
Okay, maybe that's a good thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.
-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we know we're ready to launch.
I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.
You made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock.
Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?
What the hell's it matter?
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
Riddick. Riddick.
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we are disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. Somethin' took a swipe at us.
So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
Riddick?
They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
No, I'm not. But he can.
And what about the cells?
Oh, no. No, no, no....
There is no safe.
What're you doin'?
You don't see.
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
Wanna rag your fat mouth?
Said looks clear.
Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
Aw, this can't be happening to me....
Kept calling it murder when I did it.
What's her name, anyway?
Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
Now, just a minute --
And they fell out of the sky with you?
The evidence was very meager --
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Zira....
You lied. Where is your tribe?
Certainly not.	You're a mutant.
Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
What's their program?
You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
No, Bells Beach, Australia.
A flaw I'm working on.
'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight.
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
You gotta earn trust.
I'll take that as a yes.
You gonna pull?
I can't do this.
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
You gotta tell me where she is.
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
Naw, you pull it!
Wild ride, huh?
I'm not FBI anymore.
I take the skin off chicken.
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
Yeah...
Yeah?
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
The fucking punks are surfers.
Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
Got it...
What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
Okay, Dad.
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
Aw shit.
Nice tattoo, Dietz.
Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
They're on their way to Maui.
Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
Angelo!  Don't fire!
No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
Catch of the day.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
Warm them up.
No.  I'm sorry.  I have to go. I'll, uh... I'll call you later. I'm sorry.
Ouch.
I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him.
Bye.
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
They're getting better equipped every day.
That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
That rendezvous is ten maybe twelve miles, at most! We're almost home. But the chopper won't wait.
Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here.
Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
No trouble. Today's linen day. I change all the beds once a week, whether they've been used or not... dampness. I hate the smell of dampness.  It's such a dank smell.
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
I'm not the police.
How do you know she didn't make a call?
How did she pay you?
My mother.
Milt Arbogast, Private Investigator.  Where is she, Miss Crane?
Must've needed it.
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
Yes.
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
Please!
What difference does that...
Yes?
Sure...
Lila.
Don't you know?
What should I know?
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
Huh?
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
I ought to call the police right now!
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
Maybe we can handle it together.
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
Arbogast said...
He didn't come back here?
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
Yes. I think he would have.
He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
Does that mean we can't...
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
Watch your tenses.
She always tries to be proper.
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
Sorry.
What?
The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.  Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
Bates.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy!
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.
How can you even think a thing like that!
Dirty night.
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
Norman Bates.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... she isn't herself today... I think that's it.
I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people.
It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything.
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
Oh I do... but I say I don't.
I mean... ill.  She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... I was only five... and it must have been a strain. Oh, she didn't have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... Mother met a man. He talked her into building this motel... We could have talked her into anything... and when.  Well... It was just too much for her when he died, too... And the way he died... Oh, it's nothing to talk about when you're eating.  Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left.
Well? You meant well?  People always mean well, they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that...
We'd hoped to make it straight to San Francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky. Looks like a bad day coming... doesn't it.
Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt.
Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
Do what?
Shut up!
...Forty thousand dollars!
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
What flickering light?
What's he doin'?
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
I don't agree with you.
You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
Why didn't you eat last night?
Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
The key!
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
I'd love to, at any time.
We'll be coming to the opening.
I'd love to.
Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
Where is the key?
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
And how does one go about getting these human documents, may I inquire?
Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
Which one is me? The horse?
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
Oh, God...
So you can give me an argument and tell me I'm wrong. Don't be sil, Kid.
Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
No kiddin'. What's your idea?
Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.
We'll grant that.
Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
Almost! I'll still bet I'm right, and let you write your own ticket.
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
No foolin' -- any suspect?
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
Horsefeathers!
Yes, sure, that's fine. While I'm proving my innocence, you people are going to uncover every petty kid trick I ever did ... you're going to write editorials about every cocktail I ever drank. Anything that any sane, normal person might have done will have a sinister meaning, if I did it.  Go on! Get out! I don't want to talk to you!
Cry-baby?
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.
We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
You weren't going with her?
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
That happens to be the truth.
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
Heaven knows. A lot.
What is it? What happened?
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Energy shielding positive function.
Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.
Thanks.
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Huh?
Bomb?
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
Of course not.
Yes, well...
True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
Mafhkin oble groop...
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
I'll check it.
Doolittle...
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
Ah, negative drop.
5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!
Hello, Pinback, are you there?
TALBY!
You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.
Must get lonely being up here so much.
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
You know what I think about, Talby?
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it.
Oh yeah?
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.
No kidding?
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
Yeah?
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
What's that, sir?
Ah... pity, pity...
It didn't work?
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
Commander Powell? Commander, hello!
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
Commander? Are you still there?
Phenomenology...
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
Of course.
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
Of course.
I don't know.
That's why you were riding with him.
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
You lose them!
Not yet...
I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
Bloody fucking hell...
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
Bullshit red tape.
He's company.
Where's my information?
American.
Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.
Yeah.
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
You shoot alright.
It's been known to happen.
Sorry I'm late...
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
Who else would you be?
No thanks.
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.
And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
I didn't know that you spoke French.
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?
Jujitsu.
Same thing, isn't it?
One's a lot more painful than the other.
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy.
Like Larry or Swede.
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
You were once some kind of special forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary.  Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war.  There's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around.
That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.
Know what?
That there was a gun pointed at me.
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own.
I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?
You might be a hired gun, Vincent, but I got a feeling you cost more than two bits.
Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.
My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about.  I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point.  It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.
You don't have to do this.
Yes.
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?
It's a cover, then.  A cover within a cover, a feint within a feint.  You work for the CIA, it's the only possible answer.
You think?
Give me a cigarette.
Something like that.
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
I think not.
Not here.  They might see it.
If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
Closest and oldest.
You have to stop doing that!
You speak French.
Nothing...
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
I know.
Why's that?
Why didn't you kill him?
You put everything on the line because you...
Can you get it?
I get the picture.
It's a matter of respect.  Why don't you wait outside, this won't take long.
Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
How much is that?
Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
I'd like to see you try.
This is your ship?
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
They think I'm a crooked customs agent.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
I said get on your feet!
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
Lee, you okay?
Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
What'd I say?
Try to land on your feet.
I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
What's wrong?
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
And you ain't black!
You.
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
I'm okay, you go.
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
You're not very good at this, are you?
Forget it.
You thought the Customs Agents get blown up and smuggling and Ricky Tan and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
I know.  I know.  I am sorry.
Why LA?
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Almost, but you've got to say Rich White Man all run together like it's one word.
How do you know he's our man?
Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over.
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
You pull a muscle or something?
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.
Slow down, baby.
Gimme the binoculars.
I don't want to hear this.
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
What is it?
We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
Are you okay?
Fine by me.
No mu-shu.
Are you serious?
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
Hello, Benjamin.
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
Vegas...
Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.
Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. The man has the biggest tits in Asia.
No.  I'm going to find out.
I'll give it my best shot.
Ricky Tan is alive.
Carter...
We made it, man.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  There must be something you want.
The Plaza Hotel?
No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard of the Superbill?
You move well.
No.  But I'll help you.
I'm fine.
Now you know.
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
Baby Duck?
All he wanted was some mu-shu.
I know, Master, but...
That's some serious poundage in dollars.
So was I.
Beach Boy America.  Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my --
Help me Rhonda.
It's the same thing!
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
We are both full of shit.
What the hell is that?
Where were we?
I thought you were taking me to the consulate.
You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you?  Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole.
Right....
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
Let me just clarify a few things.  I don't care what kind of cop you are in China, you have no jurisdiction in America.  Without me you are just another tourist.
You don't know what a shortcut is?
What plate?
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
You talk too fast.
It happens.
Yeah, it's good.
Now, that's American music.
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.
I got to stop that dancing in the street till all hours.
What?!
I am from outa town.
It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
You're killin' me here.
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
They put you in charge?
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.
Jesus...what do you want?
Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?
Any demands yet?
At this point we don't have much.
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.
Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
What kind of assignment is that?
Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
Don't play bullshit games with me.
Eleven thirty tomorrow the Ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is.  He said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity.
You a cop or something?
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
You got a boy friend in here yet? Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
I'm waitin' here for a name.
Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
You're hopeless.
Everything go?
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
That bad, huh?
Colette ...
Nothing.
Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
You get off on abuse or something?
What happened to your eye?
Trust me. We're safe.
Miles Davis. All Blues.
What do you want from me, Colette?
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
How much time do you have?
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
You don't like the tune, find another station.
I'm kind of busy.
Please open the door, Danny.
I need my paycheck.
He knows where I work.
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.
Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.
Colette, go.
I don't want to leave you.
Your daughter needs you.  Go.
I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.
Maybe I am dealing with it.
I know a guy.
Lead the way.
Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.
Why does it have to feel so bad?
I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
I guess there's just no substitute for good genes.
A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth ...
A quarter of a million, Jimmy.
Can your man handle that?
You mean, like to throw 'em off?
You're going to have to give me a little more than that, Jimmy.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Was he the president?
Okay
You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you.
It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?
When? When did you ever see me use?
But... why? Why would you pretend?
Wait  If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
Nah... I want to keep it.  Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when I detox?
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
Make me an offer.
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
You're serious?
Why do you say that?
Pull your pants down.
I'm sorry?
Big Bill.
Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.
I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
Bubba.
What? Is it bad?
Who is it?
Murder.  Beautiful.
It speaks!
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
I still don't know what you're talking about.
Who the hell is Jimmy?
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
No.  You've got me all wrong.  I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack.
I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
Nervous?
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
What is that? Rum and coke?
What'd you do?
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
I don't think that's a good idea.
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
And much richer as a result.
Tons and tons.
Where is Sidney's father?
And are the police sure about that?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
Youre all in this together?
Finish what my son started.
But youll never get away with it.
My documentary is due on Tuesday.
I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
Let us decide that.
Good question. You took the bait.
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
Youre not going to get away with this.
Yeah, were trying to send a message to Hollywood. Im really getting tired of all the happy endings. Its just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
But nobody wants to see that. Itll never go. Theyll rewrite you. You dont want that.
And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
I find his work overwrought.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
Were hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
Hope youre ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. Its been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
Miss Weathers.
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
I never meant to imply...
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
Not good.
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
What are we looking for?
That's not the way it's done.
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
Jesus Christ!
He filmed his victims.
Don't worry...
Whatever.
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
I'll cover you through rehearsal. Derek when do you get outta docu- drama?
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
You're not allowed to ask that.
Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
He's after me.
I'll be right back.
Don't panic.
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
Hello.
I don't know.
Do I?
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
How is that good news?
I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it.
What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
Is that a threat?
There's someone here who wants to help.
Follow me.
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
They've got her!
He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
And who is that?
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
Fuck!
OH. OH GOD. GALE --
Just Jennifer.  And you.
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
But you know who she was.
I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
Still that was a much better movie, I saw it at the premiere last week. God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business.
Oh shit it's my cell!
What the hell are you doing?
Gale Weathers would find a way.
Nobody said she was an actor.
Good twist.
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
What'd he say?
Gale he's got Dewey!
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to make you all repent for your sins, and now I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye.
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
The question isn't who I am.  The question is, who's with me.
Yes.
Where?
You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
I didn't kill anybody.
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
You ready to party hard tonight?
You know it.
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
Nope.
Thanks for the coffee.
Guess people ought to know who I am...
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
Now that it's out of your system.
I'm going... I'm going.
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
Hey, hey, it's just me.
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
So...
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
I wanna let go. I do...
Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
I don't understand...
We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
Stop it!
Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out.
Yes.
Hello.
Who is this?
I don't think so.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?
I have to go now.
Nah, I don't think so...
Gotta go.
Is this some kind of a joke?
No...
I can't think.
Please go away! Leave us alone!
...leave me alone... please...
What?
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
He's not a suspect, is he?
What brings you out to these parts?
NO! I mean... I should probably take just you.
So is Dewey your real name?
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
Sidney's father?
We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here?
Yes, you doofus.
Hold up a sec...
...yeah...
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
And my Dad? Any word on him?
Have they found my father?
Should I be worried?
How is she?
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
Off the record. No cameras.
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
Do you still think he's innocent?
Have you talked to Cotton?
Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who can't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous.
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
So where are you?
What am I doing?
...out at the airport...
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Twice.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
We had a run in the mass murder section.
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
Because, obviously they don't watch enough movies. This is standard horror movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited.
There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.
I thought everything was checked out.
He came to make up.
Like you had one.
There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say I'll be right back.
Yeah.
I'll be right back.
No, Sid.
Why are they doing this?
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
The official term is psychotic.
So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
Or a man's mentality.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
I'll be there by seven. I promise
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
Whatever. Just hurry.
It's alright. I'll get it.
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
Oh, god...
With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. Eight is enough to fill our lives with love... It's a real turn on.
Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, Eight is enough...
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
TATUM!
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
I don't know, they just did.
You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.
That's mature.
Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Why else?
Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?
It still worked in town.
Look at this!  We'll have to fix the whole wiring.  This stuff is dangerous as hell.
I'll do it myself.
What are you doing?
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
What?
And two months later, we got married.  And all because of one sentence:  With you
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
What?
An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
Martin, what-
Ellen Straub.
Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!
Twenty-three, to be exact.
No wonder you're so popular.
I don't know -- Campbell or something?
Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
Just serve.
In the same fashion as chess.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
What do you think?
About what?
About this guy, this Hugo person.
I don't have time.
I'm only asking what you think.
I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
Why, thank you, David.
I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.
Come on, David.
Juliet?
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
Family? Family? Friends? Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups don't have families, David.
Take his legs.
Is that going to be deep enough?
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --
What's the problem?
How much did you pay?
Doesn't it worry you?
What's all this for, more security?
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
You're sure? There's lots more.
I want to secure it.
Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
You looking for me?
I beg your pardon?
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
Yeah?
Where do you think you'll go?
Where will we go? Where will we go? Juliet?
I don't know anything about it.
I've never seen any of these men before.
Yes, I suppose so.
That's it, then.
Tell you what. If you do remember seeing any of these guys, maybe you could give me a phone, on this number, any time you like.
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Really?
Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
Did you know --
Just serve.
For the flat.
more than anyone she has ever met. in her whole life.
-- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she?
Who was it?
So we'll meet him, then?
I'm not usually drunk.
You're right.
No, Alex, we don't really love you.
David hasn't seen him either.
Hugo.
What?
Unfeasible.
Who's going to do it?
I thought we all were.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
I don't want to. It's different.
And now you tell me.
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
Love and happiness for ever.
For ever and ever.
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
Who was it?
No, no, it's different.
It tastes different.
You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice.
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
What are you doing here?
Forget it -- he'll come down.
No.
I refuse.
It's about me and David.
You mustn't take it so badly.
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here, you see.
What?
You were going to say something.
Downstairs.
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
No, nothing, sorry.
Two?
I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
Is this where no one stays?
No, I've never seen them.
Yes.
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
Jack, wait...
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
No one.
I'm sorry.
It was on the television.
So let's go.
And you need your sleep.
Eh, I don't know.
Oh, him. Well, he died.
A priest who dies.
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.
Working nights?
That sounds fine.
Yes.
I mean, that's what it's like.
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Your watch.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
Dad?
What was the Donner party?
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
Come here for a minute, first.
Yes?
What do you mean?
Yes.
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
Is there something bad here?
What about Room 237?
Yeah, I know.  It always takes a little time to make new friends.
Yeah, I guess so.
We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?
Okay, Mom.
All right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes?
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Red Rum.
Are you having a bad dream?
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
No.  It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.
Please...
But eh what was the matter with him?
Advocaat is it?
That doesn't matter, sir.  You're the important one.
Grady?
That's right, sir.
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
Well, he is a very willful boy.
She eh... interferes.
Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
No, we don't mind.
Bill, how do you do?
That's swell.  I like you, Lloyd. I always liked you.  You were always the best of them.
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.
Hi Lloyd.  I've been away.  Now I'm back.
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
Great.  Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through.  I don't think I can get home before nine or ten.
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.
It's about eleven thirty.
Hmm, nice.
Yeah... that's all it is.
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
What do you want me to do about it?
I dreamed that I... that I killed you and Danny.
Which room was it?
No, nothing at all.
And you didn't see anything at all?
Good.
Somebody did that to him.
Get him out of here?
Yes.
Jack!
I can't really remember.
I don't know.
Jack...
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
Why?
Why?
Stay away from me.
Jack, stay away from me!
Go away from me.
Give me the bat.
Wendy...
Wendy...
I'm Jack Torrance.
Well, that's very good time, very good.  Please sit down a minute.
Susie.
Only in a very general way.
Well...
Well, that sounds fine to me.
Not for me.
I'm intrigued.
I don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?
No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
Good.  Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.  Is your family having a look around?
Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
Right there.
Oh...
Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
Oh!
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
It's amazing how much activity is going on today.
Please, Uncle Al.
Jane-
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
Don't call me dear boy.
Yeah! What is it?
What is it?
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
Yeah? Really?
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
If we could speak alone.
Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
Excuse me?
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
What is that?
We must be a curious sight to him.
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
What of it?
No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.
Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
Wallowing in sin and lust...
He may.  But, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf.
Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
May we look at them now?
Maybe you should take this.
There are surgical ways of telling how he died... by the water in his lungs...
Not for lack of trying.
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
Listen to what you say....
Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
It's payment day.  Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month.  Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers.
Out there.  What do you see?
Are you familiar with magnets?
Three more hours...
Listen.
No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
Let loose his silent shrieking. Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand. Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
All I saw was their lantern.
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
What good is this?
To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
In test... what?
Baltus Van Tassel.
Did your father take a loan?
What was she doing?
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
Climb up!
Take the reins.
I doubt that's the end.
Are you so superstitious?
There is no such thing as magic.
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
These scars.  How did you get them?
If you want.  But...
Thank you.  No.  Here...
They have done nothing of the sort.
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
To avenge his father, and the others.
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
What did you say?
The skull is gone.
What did he say, Katrina?
I have not been able to face him yet.
I do not know.  Away.
The church.
His horse.
Keep climbing.  I will follow...
What... ?
And the blood could not have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
You scraped the dried blood from the butt of the gaff.  Where a fella's hand goes.  And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...?
You don't.
Now defendant's father had also died by that point.  Where was the defendant?  When you sent his family their equity.
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
Now, Mister Gi...
Well, what if?
So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
We discussed that.  And decided not to.
So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
Easy.  Slow is best.
Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.
...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.
Maybe it went.  Where Carl went. Over the side.
Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's eleven things...
Twelve.
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
Hey, two days with him is enough.
My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?
Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
I did.  Boy.
Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
It's public record.  If the public cares enough to read it.
You're right.  I better use two.
You're wondering why I held it.
Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
Well.  It shows the prosecutor was wrong.  It was Carl's boat that was dead in the water.  Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
Well, why does it?
Still lashed to the mast.
Maybe...?
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
You think so?
We don't let go, you s...
It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
I think you testified all the lights were on.  Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
You have to wonder.
It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
Apparently.
I'm curious.  The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
I don't think so.
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
You don't.  Remember.
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it possible.  Possible that he struck his head after death. Possible?
How is your mother-in-law?
The damage was considerable. But she's insured.  Thanks, again.
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
Is it fair to say that you do not know for certain which it was.
So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
I'm from Akron.
Nope.
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
He's my dad.
Are you guys bruddas?
Pinhead! Don't just blurt it right out.
Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.
It was a clearance.
Sure, Sid.
Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
Bowling police, step back, give him room.
Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball.
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
Think he bought it?
You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.
Oh, a professional man. What'll you have?
Seven years.
brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch.  And now we got a beautiful thing.
A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz? You know what we got? Buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
Theo.
What do you think I can do?
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
My mom was there. She told me about it. The 'Fazeli Split.'
Thanks.
Who are you? Who sent you here?
I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
What the fuck is this?
It looks like dwarf bowling.
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
You got a better offer?
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
He says that to all his wives.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
I never saw you.
Millie, I know what I'm doing.
I found dad.
I gotta go. Love ya mom.
Junior who?
If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other.
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
Profits down there, philanthropy up here.  Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
Nice set-up.
He's earned an early retirement.  But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future.  I wanna show you something.
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
Why would you help me?
I like you, Theo. You bowl with soul.
I bet you didn't know that you and Junior have something in common, Theo: Junior can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup bottle down on Junior's right hand. The table settings jump from the shock. Junior sits impassively, his face a blank.
After we eat, Dad.
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
Look who's talking!
Don't go near the bowling alley.
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
I'm a bowler.
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
What's your specialty?
Whips...orange whips.
I'm not here to - I can't...
Business.
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
Kinda tough on the butt.
No, not at all.
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
Do I want you?
No, I'm fascinated.
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
Plan C...  ...is me.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
So why do you stay?
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
Zip.
I can't tell you, Theo.
Why not?
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
Did you - kill him?
Tell me what happened Theo.
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?
You should.
I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
You don't get two chances with Junior.
At least I'll die smiling.
Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes.
Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
Theo, Buzz is dead.
What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?
Lips still for sale?
You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
I'm looking for somebody.
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
Fletcher, get away from there...
Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
They told me about sixty hours.
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
What was that?
Fifty yards and closing.
What do we use for defense?
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here?
Pull it, damn it!
Thank you, Colonel.
Captain.
Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.
What team?
Press?  No, I haven't.
Storm?  What storm?
Then why am I here?
See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
Geologists?
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
It doesn't make any sense.
They pressurize us with helium.
Everything can be killed.
I think I do.
Damn it, Edmunds?
... it raises a very serious question: What happens if Jerry gets mad?
You think he killed Edmunds?
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Pull it.
Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
Then how can it be chipped?
Yes, Harry.
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
Ted seems to have some ideas.
It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
... spiralling out of the center, you see: G is one, B is two, H is three, and so on... when I got the message.
I'm in charge.
What -- you want me to retype it?
The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
Maybe we didn't want to come back.
But what does it do?  This... sphere.
How can he be missing?
I want a name.  A real name.  This thing's full name, rank and serial number.
Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language, not the other way around.
What is that?
What sub?
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
That's quite a secret.
I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone.  Seriously.  I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- I had no idea --
Wait -- down where?
The timing has never seemed quite right.
Yeah.  Drowning.
You're next, Norman.
Get this thing off me.
Where'd this come from?
We have a library?
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish.
Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
What?  Why...
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge.
She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
... He lied to us.  He left us down here.
Yeah, he told you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
Where did you get this?
In Edmunds' things.
Don't tell me to calm down!
You said something to him, didn't you?
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Maybe you should go.  To the sub.
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
In case you die, too?
I don't trust Harry to do it.
You fixed my suit?
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
Fixing it.
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
We must've had it delivered then.
Wait a second --
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
Page 87.
Page 87.  I could never read that far.
Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say Harry, instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.
You think, in the sphere --
No.  I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible?  It talks about our sinful nature, you know?  I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are.
Looks like some sort of code.
A synthetic opium analogue.
... and may also cause bizarre halucinations.
Antibiotic.
How do you spell it?
20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed...
I'll just boost the doses.
You ever given an injection before.
Only lab rats.  Here.
I'm sorry.
You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
In the sub.  Resetting the timer. Why?
The sphere looks different.
What do you mean, different?
How's Harry?
It's getting cold.
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
Do you fear them?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
You think I manifested the snakes?
That's when you went in the sphere.
I never went in that sphere.
You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
Shut up, Beth --
Don't, Beth.
Where is it coming from, Beth?
Beth, stop it!
Stop it!
It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
C'mon --
Top shelf, is it?
Pussy.
What's that -- mistake number two, Norman?
I don't get it.
Norman?  Where's Norman?
For who?  The fish?
You'd have to ask them.
Just in time, too.
Another attack?
How are you feeling, Norman?
Time travel.  A black hole.
Which one?  Let me get the list out.
Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human.  If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.
What noise?
Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
You don't understand about the sphere.
Norman?
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
Harry?
Norman, where are you?
You know what it is, Harry.
How much time you figure to get to the surface?
Shut up and catch.
No idea.
Wait!
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
What'd you say to him?
To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
Do you?
It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.
Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
Thank you.
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
Does this mean what I think it means?
Really?
Told me what?
Who's everyone?
He wasn't feeling well.
You want me to try?
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
This is like nursery school.
Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
The creature?
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
Unless it's an act.
You seen my suitcase?
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
What?
Something... I've got...you don't.
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
What do I want with a scar ?
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
Yes, sir !
What's the hurry ?
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.
I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.
Don't you have to finish the game ?
Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you sir ?
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
They revoke our flight status.
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
Hey, check it.
Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
Funny...
Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
How do you feel about him now ?
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
Is it true ?
Good for you.
Who ?
How do I know if this is love ?
Good luck at the academy.
Zander is going for pilot, too.
You're right. Let's never stop...
Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
I'll go for that.
I'm gonna miss you.
I love you.
I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
What's wrong with you ?
...I'm sorry.
What happened to your eye ?
A lot can happen in three minutes.
Too bad for her if she's not around.
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
You saying you didn't ?
Cover me.
Way to go, amigo !
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
Well, excuse me, sir...
What ?
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
Sir, thank you, sir !
Sir, yes it is, sir.
I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
Uh, no.
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
On whose authority, Corporal ?
You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !
Let's go.
Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !
You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
Of course you don't. I doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass.
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
I'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico, I need a corporal. You're it until you're dead or I find someone better.
What's that look like to you, Rico ?
AAAAAAAAAAAA !
Cover us, Ace !
We're not leaving you here, sir !
Give'em hell, sir !
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
No thank you.
You are a monster, Zorg!
They all like this in your family, father?
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
What chip?
Let me try mine.
My mission is to protect you.
What does that mean?
Radical.
Where we going?
Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
Just say I swear I won't kill anyone.
No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like Affirmative or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.
Chill out, dickwad.
And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.
Excellent.
Torque wrench please.
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
Where you going?!
Good luck..
Alright, it!  We need it!
Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.
Yeah.  Drag, huh?
Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
So do you.
Correct.
Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
I must be destroyed.
Can you get us in there, past security?
Is it safe for them here?
Yes.
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
What's it to ya?
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
So, it's from the future, is that right?
One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
I caught one, back there.
Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
You'll learn.
Good field-dressing.
You like it?  It's my first.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
Thanks a lot.
What's that?
Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.
He'll find us, won't he?
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
No.  Never.
So much pain.
Ticklish?
You'll beg for mercy in a second.
Yes.
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Okay.
You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
Then, you kiss his ass.
I'm so sorry.
Please, don't do that...
It was an accident.
What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
Excuse me, I need to explain...
I don't know... he fell.
I don't think he's breathing.
You've got to be kidding.
What... is... happening... ?
I was trying to tell you... it's a game.
Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
Why not?
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
Please...
There's a ladder here.
My hero.  Let's go.
Consumer Recreation Services.  It's their building.  They...
Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
I think not.
Don't.  It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
The maitre d' called you Christine.
Seriously?  What did they say?
I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back.
I don't...
God, wake up, it's a con!
Get out.
Get out of my car!
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
How?  How could they have gotten anything?
They don't care about you anymore. Alive or dead is the same, as long as they bury you deep enough.
I didn't say anything.
What?
You call them...
They will!  You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
Stop talking...
Yes.
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
Yeah.
For you.
Why?
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
This isn't an escort service?
It's a profound life experience.
Why would you say that?
Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
Slow down, take a breath...
You think I know?  I paid them more to make it stop.
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
Yeah.
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N...  A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting...
What's all this for?
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
What kind of vacation?
We provide whatever's lacking.
Physical?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
That's right -- you're a left-brain word fetishist.
Drive in.
Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
It was a different floor then...
Like, this way... sort of...
I need the police.
Is there a room key?
No, you didn't...
Dinner's in the oven.
Thank you.  Goodnight.
Well... send my love, if you see him again.
Mr. Van Orton... ?
Ilsa... you're alright?
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
I'm just like him.
What's the trouble?
Where's my brother?
His behavior... ?
No.
The Hinchberger wedding.
What?
Under the Bleachers... by Seymour Butts.
Is Alan Baer the Game?  Is that what this is?
Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?
And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.
Luke, can I talk to you?
Go ahead.
Just stay there, Nell!
Nell!
Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing.  Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.
But if the group knows it's being studied as a group, you contaminate the results.  The deception is minor.
Well... we're glad to have you.
Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.
The cold sensation.  Who felt it first?
What did it smell like?
Like she smelled it too?
Yes.
I got more scared.
No you're not.  Something moved you.  You saw something.
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
Welcome Home.
Sure.
Someone is playing with you.
Why?
It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
I don't know.  A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on.  Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
Good.
Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
Maybe they're Mary's.
Is she asleep?
Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.
She needs help.
I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
No.  The world has missed you.
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
Is it over?
Maybe you did it yourself.
Why?
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
-- but the painting!
What'd you come back for, babe?
Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.
Adhara.  I told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation.
I used to hate it.  Now I like it.
As soon as you get dressed.
Why?
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
We think?
We can't find ...  ... two of our guys.
Why not?
I don't know everyone here.  He was so traumatized he split.  Maybe he was Gordon's pusher.
You think I'm staying?
I wouldn't talk.
I saw your mother on the Strip last night.  She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what I mean?
You're home, then.
No reason.
Snuffed her.
Coulda happened to anyone, man.  I never knew her to be reckless.  I mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks.  But that's it, nothing more than that.
I dunno ... Maybe they do.
You kiddin', man?  I don't need a wife and screamin' kids.  I still got my youth.
That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
Where abouts?
Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down.  I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period?
Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know.  Just popped over on a quick visit.
Not me, man.
I mean, it's already a steal, n'it -- what you said -- four hundred for this one?
Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed.
Now what.  You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that?  Boom bam boom.
Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a private service.  Private for who. Him?
He's brought in the heavy mob.
What?
They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry.  Watch it.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
Faith.
That would be too easy.
Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.
Same.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
It's been a while.
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
Well, that kind of security can't be bought.  Must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you.
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
Weren't you on a television series?
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
Oh, it just ended, then.
Not ashamed.
How'd you manage that, then.
Modelling.
Footloose and fancy free.
When did you get in?
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
Where you get your bank statements.
That's what was estimated.
your employer?
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
Based in London, but with international concerns.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
Right.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
Have you ever known me not to be.
You don't believe it was a car accident.
And how did you get it?
This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as the early 70's.  Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.
These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- after we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
Just now?  Overnight?
It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
Pushing the legal limit even then.
Not that I recall.
Won't he be looking for you about now?
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
What's in Big Sur?
How do you know?
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
Ian?
Yeah.
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.
There is?
What?
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
Like what.
How we gonna get that lucky?
Walked.
You know her?
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
You must know Ian.
Tell me.
Tell you ...
She could've had the deal!  I would've handed it to her if she wanted.  I would have given her everything.
Where the hell are you?
It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
Call me Vince.
This place is a maze.
Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
What is it?
All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.
Healing plant use among the Ki tribe of Bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art.
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.
I'm coming with you.
Yes.  John made quite a study of the whole museum.  He had a copy of my original plans.
Something tried to get into this room!
Not really.  Just the sub-basement.
I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
What's that?
Yes..thank God..
I have the species identification on these teeth.  We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program.  Call Dr. Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
What kind of hormones?
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
How about lunch?
And John?
John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  He was a fine man despite his problems --
I don't understand.
My God.  Then it was an animal.
I don't know.
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
You're not.  Where is it?
What are you going to do?
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
We have to try and draw it off!
The answer's right in front of us.
What do I do.  I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. Spooky
When was that?
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --
Is it an emergency?
Who called this meeting?
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
I'm looking for him.
What's that?
Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
Do I know you?
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
And what's that?
What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
The Federal Building was too well guarded.
No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing...
That's what I'm saying.
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
They want to discredit you -- for what?
I don't either, but it sure sells books.
I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
How can I reach you?
Your guess?
I've been using you?!
You didn't know my father --
I'm on the roof.
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
...thirteen fifty six...
Scully?
What? What are you talking about?
Why?
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
Are you drunk, Mulder?
I was until about an hour ago.
What are you implying, Scully?
Get dressed, Scully.
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
I'd been told as much.
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
Evidence of a massive infection.
What kind of infection?
I don't know.
Mulder --
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
You think they went left?
This is great. This is fitting.
What?
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
Where'd they go?
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
You can't quit, Scully.
Scully --
Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
We've got to keep moving.
On whose orders?
About what?
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
Where's Scully?!
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
How deep does this go?
Mr. Mulder.
You're lying.
Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.
What do you mean, walked?
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
Where is he?
Driver.
What about you?
I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg.
In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
Sing a song of sixpence...
A pocketful of rye...
Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am.
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
Miriam...
And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
Yes mother.
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
This isn't your responsibility. Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so.
Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or...
...a pocketful of rye.
Baked in a pie.
I don't need them anymore...
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
Give a kiss to Edward.
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
You don't know the procedure.
Do you think that's funny?
No.  Not at all.  From what I understand, he knows Im here
I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...
The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
Agent Novak?
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
A kingdom.  His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear.  A horrible primitive ugly thing.  I don't want to talk in here.
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
What about Julia?
Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
Little boy?!  That's him!
Where the hell are we?
COME ON!
You sure about this?
I heard Julia and John got married.
Good for them.
Well look at that.
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.
They're hungry.
I need you to find something in the basement...
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's lost.  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
Into Stargher.  Inside...
Nervous?
I doubt that.
Awaiting his arrival.
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
I need it.
Now.
The dog's an albino.  He'd love an animal like that.
How is she?
No.  Can you get a man close?
What else do we do?!
Considering where I've been...
Ich weiss nicht.
Give her some cigarettes.
Sit down.
You were awfully good.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
No.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
Yes.
I was told there were only two men there.
You shouldn't get mixed up in this.
The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
Oh, what was the name of that doctor? Harry's doctor?
Harry?
Just another part I've got to learn.
Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
Do I...
Gestern bein heurigen...
H-E-Z-T...
...and buried him.
Anna.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
I thought you wanted...
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
We're both in it, Harry.
I'm so sorry.
Wer ist da?
Me.
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
...you know.
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
...and my lover. He was Harry.
Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
How did you know I would be here?
...Headquarters.
Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
Harry.
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
Oh, the usual things...
That's his headache.
His.
If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
...anyway?
Of course.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
No.
No.
It's stupid to lie to me, Miss Schmidt. I'm in a position to help you.
You can help us.
It's true then?
I said another man was buried in his place.
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.
I don't...
...Austrian Police Headquarters.
Can you tell me whose...
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
See much of him before that?
Death at the Double X Ranch - Ra- a-nch.
...to him.
Ever seen one?
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
This is where he vanished.
I see.
Do you mind if I drop off somewhere on the way? I've got an appointment, won't take five minutes...
Win what?
What time is it?
Two thirty.
Well, there's not much time.
One can't just leave - please.
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
It's a military hotel.
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
No, no. Leave them for a while.
Well, look, is there a car here I can use?
I don't need a dentist. Somebody hit me, that's all.
Goodness, that's awkward.
Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
Yes.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
It's good to see you, Holly.
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
What do you want me to do?
As long as they can use you?
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
Tension? KURTZ Suspense.
What did he say?
Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?
The Roumanian?
Thank you.
Could he have been at all conscious?
Who?
Excuse me!
...Popescu...
What does he say?
Could he have been conscious?
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
I am not a bad man.
I thought he'd be here to meet me.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.
Just take it, OK.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
A shark fin?
Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
Francoise -
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
And my leopard - - maybe he hurt the first girl -- but no more.
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
Sure.
Sure, I like my leopards
But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
Perfect.
Maybe. For three years I've sung in rats' nests, while Jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out -- trying to get me a real chance. We're due for a little luck!
Show business?
I want to ask you something.
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
No. I'm quite sure.
Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
Sure -- certainly - but what's that got to do with this?
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
Why?
Just a minute, Robles.  Let him go on.
I'll take you about. Got some nice things.
But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
Yes, but what sort of a man?
I don't know.
Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
All right -- the dead, then.  In history there must have been men like that -- men with kinks in their brains --
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
It was you, Galbraith!
No.
You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
Tell me.
To know where that leopard went -  I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little freshwater college back East. I gave that up.
What do you do now?
There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
Why did you give up teaching?
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
Chief, don't you understand what this means?
Get it out of here!
I thought - is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
No  not yet.
You look swell in that threealarm number --
Who was the other man?
Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
And not a sign of the leopard?
I know. Funerals.
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
It's all right. I'm not hurt.
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, don't be soft?
We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
You wouldnt recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
I found this at your brothers.
Disney! How inter...
You... You found that at Leons?
Theres more. Your brother also purchased a young boy for 15,000.
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You dont mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is hes either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But Ive seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why Im here at such a late hour. I need 20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
Excuse me?
I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after.
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
Couldnt Nazi hunters do the job?
I still dont buy your story but I figured it cant do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about.
Who is Friedman?
You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. Theyre in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
Have you got a pen?
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
...7548. Have you... Have you found him yet?
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
When did you get back?
Why dont you ask when I left the Mondrian?
Sorry?
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you cant satisfy him?
You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?
How did you break into my office, Deborah? Ladies of your standing dont learn to pick locks between shopping trips.  Come on, Deborah! Acting dumb doesnt suit you! Who knew Id found dirt on your brother, huh? Who knew it was in an envelope? Taking me for dead, whod want to make sure it didnt fall into the wrong hands?
Ive had a long and unpleasant day. Im tired and Im angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leons boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish youd use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what youre owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? Hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Leon hung himself.
Adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didnt he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Leons not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leons found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned Id exceeded his expectations.
One just doesnt... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
You bastard...
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
I didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?
Something like that.
You know something? Ive just seen so much ugliness I dont think Id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  Id hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if thats the way you want it.
What are you doing? You cant. I...
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.
Get to the point, will you...
What do you suggest?
Your parents arranged the visit to my office?
The dead can wait.
Croissants.
Europe...  France. Im French but I live in London...  ... England.
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
Did you not enter this country illegally?
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitneys trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...
Yes... Good, good...
... Fine. Ill go for the safe place.
On the bed!
Whats this place? A hotel of some kind?
Yeah... The Diplomat.
The company. We all work for the company.
What company?
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, Ive got to get to...
Downstairs... At the front... Jesus...
La what?
Ive got work tonight, Jane.
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one Id given you and then got back, remember? I cant find it. Do you know where it is?
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say youre my secretary, all right?
Good afternoon, Mrs...?
Okay. Recommended...
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.
Anything at all. I presume you wont want to take the boy with you when youre finished?  Theres a 500 fee for disposal. The boy is yours, you understand?
Does it matter?
Problems?
Am I supposed to know him?
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
Where is Friedman?
Dont jump any red lights.
Shut up and drive!
Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, lets go...
Im overcome by your public-spiritedness.
Could someone have hurt you that bad?
Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
Hyatt... Friedmans... at the Hyatt...
The Hyatt...? Whats that?
The ladys not a friend. Shes a whore.  Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies.
Questions can amount to revelations. Now, Id hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
Oh. This is... Wed arranged to meet tonight and Im due to return to Paris tomorrow...
Yes. You wouldnt know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leons not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.
Good reasons?
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leons story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
I know his work better than I know him.
The acid bath?
Why did you kill him?
So why didnt he?
I think youd rather not know what I think.
Try again, and this time be polite.
What sums?
Leeloo... is... she's...
...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
I was talking to the cat.
At least, the cat comes back.
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
Eat your dinner.
What did you get?
When?
Don't go.
You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
No, don't make trouble.  It's nothing.
I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
Don't be so sure.
Look,dirt!
What time is it?
I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
No!  Don't go.
I'll try.
Promise...please don't THX leaves the room.
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
What are you doing?
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
They don't know.
They're watching us now.
No one can see us now we're alone.
THX!
I thought you were through with it!
What?
Why did you have LUH come here?
Why are you so concerned?
I don't feel well.
I'm leaving.
I was lost.
We've lost SEN!
What?
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
I don't know.
You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence:  Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5.  Roommate 3417 LU...H.
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.
No!....
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
You don't know that!
All right...
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
I can't understand.  The sedatives....
....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me, I slipped on....
Who the heck're you?
I don't need one.
Uh... at least fifty.
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
How long are we going to stay?
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
Your partner?
Driving in circles, waiting for-
Right.
Good, now the other side.
Okay, let's go in.
T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area.
Bev, you're the greatest...
Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
5'7
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
Vito Cornelius?
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
Sightseeing.
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
What about the gold?
I'm sorry.
Q! How are you?
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
Don't you think you're overreacting?
I thought your specialty was good-bye.
I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
What about the uranium?
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
Come on. I know better than that -
Fishing?
Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?
Let's take a look at the body.
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
We work in the dark. We do what we can.
I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?
I got you covered.
I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.
I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
Boyfriend?
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
He's killed closer.
Maybe. But why are we going up instead of down?
Put your back to the railing. Sit up on it.
Sleep well?
I didn't say when I want to die -
And when might that be?
Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
Only what I read in the newspapers.
'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.
... What's Harmsway done?
A three-thousand ton frigate doesn't just vanish into thin air.
Indeed they are.  Deadly little things.
Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
Arnie, thank God.
Listen to me carefully.  First of all, Carl isn't here.  DEA's got him and they'll hang on to him until arraignment, which will probably be tomorrow.  So here you're wasting your time.  Are you with me?
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
How much do I pay him?
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very adept at being on my own.  I've always had a man in my life.  Always.
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
I can't do that.
Carl, that's insane.
Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --
This is different.
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent.
She asked me not to.
Me, too.
My Leica's gone.
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
Not yet.
What do you think?
Just watching you.
I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
Tell me what to do, Carl.  I need guidance, not a fucking platitude.  I'm not bringing a child into the kind of life I grew up with.  I won't do it.  I want our life back.
I don't know.
No telltales.  Nothing to read. Not touching my face.  Not even blinking.  No giveaways.  How're you feeling?
Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up.
I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
So does half of San Diego.
Depends on the state.
Nobody said shit, Eduardo --
One chance here, Eduardo.  Make us believe you got a boss.  No boss, it's all on you.
So go shower already.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.
Any way we can do it better?
That triple the amount of stuff is going through.
I have money --
She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.
She hasn't called you?
Like you protected Landry?
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
It will be your chariot!
No, no, it's not possible.
Can we have it quiet?
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.
On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
Pack Up Your Troubles.
The lyrics are - are very simple. It's, er, Row
Yes, Captain.
Goodnight, Bones.
Goodnight, Doctor.
Yes.
Not General Korrd.
I cannot be certain.
Who is it he reminds you of?
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
We don't have 1.2 hours.
You must allow us to act.
Captain, what have I done -
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
I ordered you to defend this ship.
You ordered me to kill my brother.
You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!
There, you see? See?
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.
A t.
a... n...uh, d... end of word.
New word. b.. a... um...
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
I believe I have found a faster way.
Uh-uh.
Spock... the booster rockets.
I must have your starship.
You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?
I'll take you to the bridge.
I don't control minds. I free them.
Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.  Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
I hide no pain.
Sybok.
You haven't told him?
Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn  is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called...  ...Space Paranoids.
That all you can say?
I'm sorry -
If you think -
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
Well, isn't it -- ?
What's that?
Flynn...  Where's Ram?
It's time I levelled with you, Tron. I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a User.
Then...
I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.
Not us, I hope.
Hey... you guys OK?
What's wrong with that area?
Let's get some power here.
Jump.
Whew. You never were much for small talk.  She still leave her clothes all over the floor?
All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..
They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
We have to.
I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
Why is everything...like this?
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
Can you cover me for an hour?
You know you can always talk to me.  Right?  Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.
Immediate roll.  Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge.					* Vehicle is red-and-white						* convertible.  You have six minutes.
In the helicopter.
What?
Yep.  Sleep fast.
Fourteen, Harry.
It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
Son of a bitch!
You want me to just hang-- ?
I'll just hang then, shall I?
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
It can't be.
Put a tap on her phone.
What're you talking about?  We have that.
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!!
You know about that?
I thought this look like your work.
You're welcome.
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
Sorry.
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
I don't know.  I guess... I wanted to see what would happen.
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
You're damaged goods, lady.
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
I need you to talk to Dana.  The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.
Hi honey.  What's going on?					*
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
Uh huh.
They said you had to run out.
Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park.
Why did you continue to see him?
Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
Yes.
I think so.
The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be--
I'm not wearing any.
Yes.
What is it?
God, you have great legs.
No.  Much more.
If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?
We must be in the Florida Keys .				* .  .  the Overseas Highway					* connects the islands to the mainland.
What are you going to do?
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
Not yet.  But we'll find him.
Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me.
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
Yeeaoowww!!
No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
Go ahead.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Yes.
Were they trying to kill you?					*
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
And you chased one?
What is it you want me to do?
What's happened?
It's serious.  That's all I can				* say.  Just meet on K Street under				* the Key Bridge.  At eight sharp.				*
What is it you need me to do?
Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married.  They'll be looking for a man traveling alone.
You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax.
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
Wait a minute -
Did you get the letter?
Gotten your mail yet?
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
Knock wood.
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.  What do you think would taste good?
Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.
How come?
Oh, hush up.
Tell him we gotta go.
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
The letter he sent.
Get it.
And here we are.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.
I love to get pie after a movie.
Would you like to get some pie?
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
Where are you from.
Like it?
Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.
Four hundred bucks.
He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.
At the movies?
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?
Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
Who?
A real live pimp?
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
What?
Yes.
You will?
Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One-Armed Boxer.
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
No no no no no no no no no...
Why?
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
I think what you did...
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
Leavin' Detroit. Goin' off on vacations, startin' new lives, business trips. Fun, fun, fun, fun.
But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant.
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon. Don't 'cha think?
It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.
That rhymes.
Can you live with it?
Yeah.
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
I'm her husband.
Wannabee nigger...
You comin' to L.A.? When?
Get the fuck outta here!
Clarence sent a letter?
What's so fuckin' good about it? Actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head bunch of women in the world. It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional instability before they can get their SAG card. Oh, guess what? I had a really good reading for T.J. Hooker the other day.
I don't know! A fuckin' lot!
Is he big league?
Elliot Blitzer.
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Where?
The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
Clarence...
What the fuck did you bring that for.
In case of what?
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
Now's a helluva time to play what if.
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
Yeah, let's just get outta here.
Three kung fu movies.
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -
No. No, you don't.
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts.
He wants to talk ya.
Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
Don't lie to me, motherfucker. You apparently think I'm the dumbest motherfucker in the world! Don't you? Say: Clarence, you are without a doubt, the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world. Say it!
Say it, goddamn it!
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.
Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick.
Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is Doctor Zhivago. This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. Sophie's Choice, Ordinary People, Kramer vs. Kramer, Gandhi. All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.
Me too, Boris.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
Why does he trust you?
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
Go to the liquor store -  Where is there a liquor store around here?
Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help.
You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes. Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a joke about this -  - I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!
What?
What makes you think I could do that?
Who is he?
Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.
I got some money I can give you -
Keep it.
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
No.
They didn't tell me.
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
Where'd you come from?
Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -
Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.
Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
No, sir!  I just want to do my part. To get us back on top...in charge of the planet.  And I have the experience, I know who the people are...
San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you James?
James!  Nobody ever calls me that.
They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
A jail?  Prison?
Hiding?
It's so clean.  No germs.
You're afraid of germs?
1995?
What?
No more drugs.  Please...
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?
You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.
We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
And I was in it?  What did I do?
It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me.
Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
We need gas.
I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
What's the matter with your leg?
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
Shot!  Who shot you?
Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?
I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
The gun! ... I lost it
Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
Just like that?  You were in prison?
I don't know -- I don't remember.
I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
IT WASN'T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL!
James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
You want me to rob him?
You... you couldn't have heard me.
They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!
On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, We did it.
Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop.
In the 18th century there was no such thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think.  He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible bad things called germs that get into your body and make you...sick!  He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands.  What is this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?...germs!
I'm not crazy.
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
They hurt you!
Look at those assholes, they're asking for it!  Maybe people deserved to be wiped out!
What are you talking about???
A lawsuit?  You going to sue them?
What....???
Never saw him before in my life.  Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.
I'm here about some monkeys.
I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  For the future!
I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
This part isn't about the virus, is it?
What...virus?
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
No, thank you.
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
That's 'cause he's dead.
Maybe I do.
Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you. Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But that ain't mean I don't know what's going on around here. They're all cursed. Yes sir.
Who's cursed?
I got things to do.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
You afraid of the dark?
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
More or less.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
Who the hell is this!?
Accident.
You've got to be--
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
Bobby Cooper. What brings you to Superior, Coop?
An overheated car.
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
California...
Live there?
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Like you don't know.
This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?
Talk?  About what?
I did?
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
You meant it.
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
And tell her what?
Next time you'll do just fine.
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
I guess this is what they call ironee? Hunh?
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?
I wanna play a song on the juke.  You got a quarter?
What happened to your hand?
How about I pick one out for you?
Cause she's dead.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
But you was going to fight for me.
How old are you?
No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
Nope.  Darrell.
So?
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Yeah, I can fix it.
Ninety-two.  Course half hour from now might be seventy-two. These clouds move around a lot.
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
What the hell happened to my car?
Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split.
...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .
I want my hundred and forty-five dollars.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
Yeah, but it was shot.
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Look, Harlin.
Darrell. I'll get you your money. I just have to get something out of the trunk.
I want my car.
That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.
Soda.  You got any soda?
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
Do you have to call me that?
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
That's all right.  I got it.
You're welcome, Grace.
Drove into Superior?  What for?
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
Where you headed?
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
I pack up and go somewhere else.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Thank you.
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
My face tell you all that?
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
Lift me down.
Beautiful?
Nothing like a little liveliness.
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
How do you know he's still not here?
You love him?
No.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would ... do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
Oh yeah. It's beautiful, beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here.
In cash?
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to feel it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
Grace ... Grace?
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
I'm not coming back.
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
He was a cop, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.
Bobby? Are you all right?
And I love you too.
And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
Morning, officer.
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
But which I can get. No problem. Look, I can sell my car in Vegas. Blue book it's worth 16 at least. I just need the 150, uh...
I need a ticket.
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
I don't care, just get me there.
I'm sorry.  It's just ... you know ...
Wrong number.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best.
Help me, Grace, help...
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
You've made a considerably wise decision.
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
Do you remember me getting sick?
No that's it.
Oh shit...
I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?
I don't know Megan.
I assumed because of the train.
You've misunderstood.
It's for last week's game.
Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection?
You could have poured coffee in Starbucks, you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings, you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet... You could have been one of ten thousand things... but in the end, you chose to protect people. You made that decision... and I find that very, very interesting.  Now all I need is your credit card number.
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.
Yes.
Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.
It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
I have to go now.
One last question.
We are.
In under six seconds.  I've heard.
I'm going to go in.
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
I'm going to work out.
No.
There's no more left?
That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.
You represent someone in Philadelphia?
No.
...And everyone lived happily ever after.
There have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years. I've followed each one of them... A Seven-three-seven crashes on take off. One hundred and seventy-two die. No survivors... A hotel fire downtown. Two hundred and eleven die. No survivors... And am Amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city. One hundred and thirty one die. One survivor. He is unharmed.  I've spoken with your husband about his survival. I suggested a rather unbelievable explanation. Since then, I've come to believe, that my explanation, however unbelievable, is in fact, true.
What was the money for?
I don't get it.
Keyser Soze
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.
You heard right.
His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him.
Doubtful. With all that coke, they'll be ready - which brings me to sunny spot number two. Even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we get nothing.
County. I was in for fraud.
What the hell do you want?
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -
They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.
Don't hurt me.
McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
What fence? Who?
Never heard of him.
What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place?
You watch your mouth.
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Maybe more.
We'll make it.
Hungarian?
What if I
Just do what I tell you.
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
The answer is no.
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
I shivved him.
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
A little of both.
We want to meet him.
Tell him we'll meet.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.
Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
He was a corrupt cop, Verbal.
Keaton was a piece of shit.
According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
The first thing I learned on the job, know what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow?
I'm not a rat.
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
He loved her.
Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        +
You got him wrong.
I don't know about that.
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
The D.A. gave me immunity.
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
Gee, thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion. You'll pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me They'll bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out? If he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid of me.  After that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again.
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
Give a guy a break, huh?
Why didn't you say anything?
Wait a minute.
I don't have a minute. Are you saying it was Keyser Soze? You told the D.A. you didn't know who it was.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Then why didn't you help him?
I don't
There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
Why lie about everything else, then?
You think he's..?
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
I don't think this is a good time...
He won't talk.
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
I married into it.
Interesting business.
And you like it.
Would you like a drink now?
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
No.
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
Scottie, I need a friend!  Someone I can trust! I'm in a panic about this!
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
There are things you didn't tell me.
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
She... went into the Bay.
No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did.
What for? Who are you?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
Do you live here in the hotel?
What about?
Let me come in.
About three years.
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
I want to know who you are.
No, you don't owe me anything.
Because I'd like to have dinner with you.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
I'll take care of you.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
No.
Why?!
Honest?
But Scottie, you don't have to!
Scottie, what are you doing?
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
They're none of them right.
The color of your hair...
Judy, please it can't matter to you...
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me.
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks.  And... let's see... to start...
I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
How does it work?
We're going awfully far.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
Where are you going?
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
You can't. You're afraid!
Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
Your accident...
We'll find him.
I made it.
Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
Some money.
Love me... keep me safe...
You don't remember.
At...
Please drink your coffee.
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
You like it, too.
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
What?
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
No... this is the first time for me, too.
Oh! Yes. Hello.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.
I hope we will, too.
What?
We have.
Good-bye.
Shopping?
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
What are you thinking?
I don't like them.
No.
Here with you.
Have you been here before?
No!
No, I can't tell you!
Take me away from here?
...somewhere in the light.
I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
No... it's in shadow.
What else?
A grave...
How do you know?
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
No!
I'm here, I've got you...
I had the dream. The dream came back again...
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
Tell me.
No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up...
And it's a all real.
My love... because I love you.
Let me go.
To the church, I must go there.
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
You believe that I love you?
Why?
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
Well?... what'll you do?
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
I'm having one now.
Oh!
I've never run across one like that.
How's your love life, Midge?
Aren't you ever going to get married?
Three whole weeks.
What.
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
Pop Leibel.
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
Here you are.
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
Out. I've got things to do.
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
Mmm, yeah, I guess...
All I said in the note was: Where are you? That doesn't sound desperate to me.
Naturally.
What is it, a still life?
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
How soon can it be altered?
The stripper's here.
What?
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
Why was the floor wet?
It's sacrilegious.
One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I?  Prison Communications.
You don't know what you're doing.
What are you talking about?
What do you think you are doing?
Why?  Why? She's dead. Why are you calling an ambulance?
That is not an option. There is no multiple choice here.
Sure, why not.
Her fucking head was caved in.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
We've already done this.
How do you figure?
We have to get going.
Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less.
Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
Don't talk to me about character.
What is your problem?
I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.
Are you solid with that?
It has to be done.
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
Great. Fine. Perfect.
Fish?
Your investment ideas never work out.
I don't think so Boyd.
Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
What's your fucking point?
What's goosed?
He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.
Who's up for making some real money?
Oh, Jesus...call the police.
No.
Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
Nobody knows.
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them.  Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that?
Go ahead.
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
It goes; Today is the first day of the rest of our lives.
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
Easy Boyd.
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
I don't know! I just want to get married.
Exactly! Exactly my point.
No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right.
Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
Take care of business.
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
You got a nasty side to your thought process.
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
Hear what?
Now?
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
You're sick.
Moore?
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?
Easy Micheal.
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.
I do.
I don't think so.
I think so.
Yes.
Why what?
Are we going to do this again?
He is.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
Who else?
You expect more what?
Time out.
That's absurd.
Problems?
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
I will.
Not yet.
I'll see you tomorrow...
No. Just like an hour or so.
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
Can we just talk this out?
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
No it's not okay. It's not.
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
He kept saying he was protected.
Move the bodies?
I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...I just love you so much...So much...
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
OK, OK. You guys just go back in. Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. Go on.
I just want her to be happy.
Where did you get that?
I got to agree with that.
The first day.
What?
Did she believe you?
Greenpeace.
Greenpeace?
Pup corn?
Well that ought to be about the end of that.
Yup.
She's dead.
Fucking desert.
He was a computer program for crissake.
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
I've seen worse.
If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
I don't set policy.  You have the key?
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
Only because I got pulled out early.
What happens if I can't catch him?
If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.
I'm still making adjustments...
I'M WHAT?!
Get that fucking thing away from me!
Show me his physical sensory level.
Turn it down!
Talk so I can understand.
Fuck it! Hold tight!
It was me, what?
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
I think I understand what you have in mind...
John died.
That's not true, Parker.
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
You all right?
You ready for this?
What happened when he was 17?
I'm still working on it.
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
What does that mean?
Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?
This is my area of expertise.
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!
He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.
How did you find out about the toxin?
You're not capable of it.
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
Nice work.
That's why I'm asking.
Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
I couldn't tell you.
GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
Where did you plant the C-4?!
Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his ReElection Rally...
Is that all?
Just one... why me?
I'll come back all the time.
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
Why?
Are you mad at me?
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
No.  But once I heard...
Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
No.
Do you have any idea who she is?
What's happening to me?
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
No.
What?
Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
Um...
Is everything alright?
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
Claire.
What was her major?
And the third one?
I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Wow.  Got here just in time.  I brought you this.
What is it?
Jody--
Thanks, but I'm fine.
You got it.
...no...no...no...
Please.  That's all I need.
What?
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
Then what was it?
Something was there.  You saw it.
Please.
I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
I had just been left by Richard.  I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.
I don't know.
I can't believe this is happening.
That could take days.  I need to do something now.  Don't you see?  She wants us dead.
Jody he was lying.
I guess not.
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
Trust me, Claire.  You hear something... change the subject.  You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake.  You know what happened.  The rest is only details.  And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those.  If you want to put this back together...just let it go.
What's their name?
When's she out of here?
Don't.
It's Saturday.
You did a great job.  She's a good kid.
It's just us now.
Yup.
Did you...
After that.
Of what?
Of him I think.
Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.
Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
I'd never be able to live with mysel--
Norman, you have to look at this!
Hurry...
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
Claire?
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
You know what that does to me.
...for my father.
Sorry.  You understand.
No.  Look!  In the window.
It's a flare.
A flare?
It's a ghost.
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
When you do this, I swear...
What are you doing?
You're not at the center.
Norman...
Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.
I never said...
Are you lonely?
What are you...?  No.
But then you've been so much better...
Yep.
You told me that I was...
You don't remember?
In the living room...
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
But I don't remember.
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
The...
I don't like this, this...
I was there.
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
To Caitlin!!
Stop...
Get out of my way.
She did it.
We have to get out of here.
What?
She can't be here without me.
How can you be sure?
Claire...
Adamant.
I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
MADISON!
I'm not going.
I thought you were someone else
Sounds good - thank you
But - If you could show me round now - and I'll meet you later?
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
I lost the touch
My names isn't ANGELA...
I'm a dentist
...Shit!
You don't know?
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
What did you do with her?
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?
Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?
Tell me about your wife...
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
What?
But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
Why did you let him in?
What was I supposed to do?
It's what you would do to me
Don't you want me now LESLIE
Well, what do you think?
What's this all about?
You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL?
Yes, that would be nice - I'll call round some time...
Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
I'll be sure to...
Sugar?
I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...
I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
You look pretty.
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
Take your time.
I understand.
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
Did you try to fight him?
I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, Don't worry
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
How long?
She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid.
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
The skinny brunette.
Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
Just check out the car.
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
What if I'm right, Gloria?  What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong?  What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
That bothers you?
No.
I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door...  I think I looked away.  A split second. Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin.  There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think. In the chest.
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
I said he did.
A ride.  You want one?
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
You can trust me.
I think we just need to get wasted.
About what?  How to improve your breast stroke?
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
Get off my property.
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
Yes.  God, Mom...
I won't.
Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
So you got my mom's money.
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
Duquette.  Forget him...
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
And you believe her?
Um-huh.  And guess what else?  I have toys.
What's that supposed to mean?
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
So Suzie, you called us, remember?
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
Story's the same, Detective...
I had to go look for this coupon.
The one you bought at school.
Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the door.  I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office.
Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
Come off it, man... It was an accident.
That was the same thing Ray said.
Trust me, the guy's dirty.  He'll like it.  Especially the part about offing me.  Now get out of here.  Go make yourself a new friend.
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  You ought to try it some time.
You hear that?
Cornelius..
Oh god!
Dinoine chagantakat!
Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
Good, you start tomorrow.
Not one this big.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Oh sure, Fred.
They're Amish.
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
I saw him.
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
Hey, Sam...
I'll be all right. You just do as I say.
Don't let them hurt you.
Are you really ever coming back?
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
Sure have, Sam.
Oh, he's good.
Yeah.
What have you got?
So one of them got to him.
Maybe.
Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
Johnny 
It's all over, Paul.
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
There'll be another train.  The man who was killed tonight was a policeman, Sam. It's my job to find out who did it. I want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there.
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
We do not go into your courts.
She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility.
You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
I was wrong.
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.
Does anybody know I'm here?
Only the elders.
What?
Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these.
Your husband's?
Something wrong with buttons?
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
But Stoltzfus said...
I know what he said.
A real fireball.
Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
Sure.
Won him over just like that.
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
Aren't you? After today?
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
That's God's way!
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
Good. Take care of that woman's name for me. And watch your ass.
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
Not yet.
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
His name is John Book.
Is the English dead?
No...
I know.
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
You shame yourself.
You have no right here!
You might have killed him!
Momma... are they angry with us.
You new?
Dont know any doctor jokes.
The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we werent around, theyd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.
Shame you had to spot I wasnt the real thing.
Whos she?
Makes her look even more innocent.
What is it?
Nuclear.
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
The King pipeline.
Hes sealed himself in.
Like riding a bike.
We cant.
So isnt it time you unwrapped your present?
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
Perhaps after this ... test?
Quite the opposite, in fact.
Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
Who told you to look at Elektras files?
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektras ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
The report King bought. Its a manual. Renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
Is maybe...the inside woman.
I met you at my fathers funeral.
My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. Hes decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
Thats every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  Thats why youre here, isnt it? You think I cant do it. You think Im going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
You dont take no for an answer, do you?
No.
Were alright.
I know.
Someone wants to kill me, Id rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
Really?
You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.
What are you talking about?
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
He used your exact words.
Im coming with you.
Not interested.
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. Im going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfathers name, the glory of my people.
Valentin Zukovsky.
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rats nest.
Where did you get this?
Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
Whats your business with Elektra King?
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
You are out of your league.  Shes working with Renard.
Istanbul.
Mother of God.
What class sub does your nephew run?
Warm.
How would you know?
Marvellous.
Wrong answers?
Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is stalking the Watchmen.
You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
I'm here, Laurie.
Would you like me to stay?
Mm hmm.
Collect me?
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
Cured, yes.
The south pole.  Times flowing backwards.
Jon --
Jon -- for Gods sake, what do you see?
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
She's with me.
What??
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
And what if youre wrong?
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
Damn straight.
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
Old?
Memory lane.
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
Antarctica??
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
This'd better not be what I think it is.
They're following us.
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
They're practically on us . . .
That's because --
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
. . . What??
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . .
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
Where's Laurie?
I don't think she's coming with us.
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
SHUT UP, Rorschach.
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
What does this mean?  What does it --
Am I free to go?
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
Please.
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
Maybe I'll do that.
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
You know women normally change five times more than men.
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
OK, you can turn around!
You're nothing but a... a...
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
The wind blows... the fire burns...
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
...Like love...
Because...
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
We're going to get my little girl.
And that's how I ended up here.
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
Anybody else?
I can't feel a thing, Hon.
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
My husband...
What?
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
Huh?
What do you mean what?
What's going on between you two?
How many?
Seven.
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
'Eh, Chief?
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
MOVE YOUR ASS!
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
Nothing, just lookin'.
Let's go.
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
Go! Go!
That's one piece of four problems.
Stop her!
I think --
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
I understand.
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
... What's going on?
Tom...
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
Don't...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Amy...
Anything harder?
Snuff?
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
Dino...
What the fuck... !
What can I do for you today?
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?
I have no idea.
It's about money, all right, but not yours. You see, me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance.
It's okay, honey. Everything's going to be all right.
Come again?
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Who's this?
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
Died instantly?
I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
Yes.
No, I didn't.
Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border.
Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
Excellent.
Okay, does anybody here know what's going on?
Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about I don't believe in vampires because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires.
You too, preacher?
In other words, no.
Yep.
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
Ain't it the truth.
I just bet you would. Don't even think about it. Besides, I want to have one night's sleep in an honest- to-goodness bed. The beds in the home are okay, but they're not like a real bed.
Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
What are these for?
I promise.
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even less time, so I'm only giving you the count of three. One...
I'm going for 'em!
What's going on?
Where are you taking us?
Mexico.
What?
In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, Digayo. When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called The Titty Twister. From what I hear, you can't miss it.
See ya.
-- you got your microwave --
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
Whiskey!
He signaled the Ranger.
What the fuck is wrong with you --
I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, Help us!
Gotcha!
Do they have a waterbed?
How's it feel?
I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?
That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
Didya look at the border?
I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit.
What?
What the fuck is she doin' there?!
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
What?
Duly noted. Now, shut up.
You okay?
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
Is that him?
That's what you think?
I'm lookin' scared?
You know what you look like?
No, Richie, what do I look like?
My shit is together.
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
Move it, dirtbag... !
Fuck off.
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
Celebrity Films.
What?
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
How'd you find me here?
Don't ask questions.
That's cuz I'm married to you.
Great. See ya then.
Where's Audrey?
You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
My God. He's going after the nest.
What are you doing?
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
It's good to see you, Nick.
What?
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
What did you do with her body?
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
Really? I'd like to find out.
Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
We? I don't think so.
Stop talking.
Look, you cocksucker...
Of what sort?
That's right.
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
They're no friends of mine.
You're making me very angry.
Enlighten me.
You'll get it when we get there.
He's lying.
Big date tonight?
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
There's not much illegal.
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
Sounds good, pops.
Snuff films.
How old are you?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
Good question.
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
Where does he sell it?
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
It's their Presidential Suite.
Who is he?
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
I try to be.
My condolences.
Pittsburgh?
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
You're kidding me, right?
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
They all sound big at the talking stage.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
No. What's this?
Plan B. Here ya go, honey...
Calm down? We're going away for life and you tell me to calm down?
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
You spotted them, huh?
How 'bout when you went down the stairs?
No shit? What're some of 'em?
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
So what? Where's it say in this script he's white? Color is what the part needs, man, somebody to do it has some style. The way it is now, Ronnie could do it, play himself, some cracked out asshole.  So whatta you think of the script?
Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than Lovejoy.
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.
I don't believe this.
You know Laurel Canyon?
Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.
Bear, you're not really gonna -
Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of Freaks and put 'em in this other one, Mr. Loverboy.
I can't do it.
You positive about that?
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
I'm working on a few things.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
C-18.
What I'm sayin' is the man wants his money and he wants it now.
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
Depends. Who's this?
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
What?
Look at me, Ray.
That's correct. Look at me.
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
Movie producer? Yeah, why not.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
Okay, I follow you so far...
You're joking.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.
Harry, lemme give you some advice.
You're not looking at me, Harry.
Come on, Harry - Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
Fuckin' basketball game.
I'm here.
You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
That's it? That's your movie?
I said I had an idea, that's all.
The shylock's the good guy.
You mean, Leo?
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
Is that right, that's what you do for a living?
I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.
Maybe a few times I have.
Really? You ever been arrested?
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
Mr. Lovejoy.
Who's the star?
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in The Cyclone.
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
I hope it's nothing serious.
She looks familiar.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
What?
Never say anything unless you have to.
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
Here's your keys, Harry.
Really.
I found him.
Ask your man here.
Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
You mean like we don't give a shit.
Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.
So you want to know.
One of mine?
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
Wow.  Mind if I take it for a spin?
You don't open an account, Leo, you put it in a safe deposit box. Dip in whenever you want.
I know what a vig is.
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
Like in Bride of the Mutant, when you played the whole end with that torn top.
You saw that one?
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, Cabin in the...
Yeah, you know when Bette comes up to the guy on the porch, gives him a flirty look and says, 'I'd kiss you, but...'
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
Yeah. Right.  Listen, Touch of Evil's playing near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican?
I just caught the end.
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
I want to know.
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
What happened?
Why not?
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
I don't know.
You're as bad as Harry...
You okay?
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
Were you scared up there?
You don't act like it?
I'll be right back.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. You won't need the coat.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
He already knew it.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
I'm thinking about producing.
So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.'  'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic.'
Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there.  What do you want, Doris?
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...
I don't have a dog.
Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
I'm going.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Harry, we spoke with Martin.
Harry -
Which two?
What money?
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories.  Of us.
I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey -  This your ride, Chili?
And after all, you have such morals.
A passenger liner. Over.
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
A passenger liner, north island. Over.
Roger, North Island. I am tied to the passenger vessel Chimera. And she is afloat. Repeat, she is afloat. Over.
I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
Will you let me look?
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
Wrong. It's Friday.
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
The turbine blew.
Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.
Where from?
Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
One more?
What?
It just occurred to me I don't know your first name. All this time and I don't know it.
Roger.
Ready?
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
I'm saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest.
Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
Seen a lota movies.
Smokes?
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
Yeah, yeah.
Smugglers maybe.
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
What is it?
Threw a turbine blade.
Like I always say --
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry.  It happened a month after she ran away.  She's been dead all this time...
So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?
It looks like it.
Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on C deck. Cabin 400.
If they knew what they were carrying.
I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
I think you know.
What?!
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
Yeah.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
Sorry.
Morning everybody.
Too big. More like a freighter.
You mean, before she sank.
Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
Then why didn't they take it.
Probably didn't have time.
That's what I call a payday.
Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
Coffee.
You're a pal.
Stay away. Or else.
No.
Headache, nausea, lights?
Lights?
Sudden flashes of light.
I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.
You okay?
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
It's my pen name.
Yeah. Thanks.
Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her.
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
You're more practical than superstitious.
Are you sure?
It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
Guess that'd be me. Again.
You just shoot at something?
Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
Only something must've gone wrong.
Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
I don't know, are we?
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
What happened.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
Murphy to Epps.
No, you may not.
Nope.
Maybe it was more than that.
They went crazy.
If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
Greer's gone. He broke out of the tank.
You killed them.
The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
What do you say, Dodge?
Looks like it's adrift.
Call the Coastguard?
How's that?
What?
Yeah.
You're up late.
Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.
I don't know.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Ho-ly shit.
Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.
Never been more thirsty in my life.
Drink up then.
How're you feeling?
You don't remember?
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
I wish I could tell you. I'd be real interested to know myself.
Must be a little too the truth, eh Dodge?
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
